2037G "Natlan Exploring" "combinatorics,dp,math,number theory" "You are exploring the stunning region of Natlan! This region consists of n cities, and each city is rated with an attractiveness ai. A directed edge exists from City i to City j if and only if i<j and gcd(ai,aj)\xe2\x89\xa01, where gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.Starting from City 1, your task is to determine the total number of distinct paths you can take to reach City n, modulo 998244353. Two paths are different if and only if the set of cities visited is different." -999
2037F "Ardent Flames" "binary search,data structures,sortings,two pointers" "You have obtained the new limited event character Xilonen. You decide to use her in combat.There are n enemies in a line. The i\'th enemy from the left has health hi and is currently at position xi. Xilonen has an attack damage of m, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.Xilonen has a powerful ""ground stomp"" attack. Before you perform any attacks, you select an integer p and position Xilonen there (p can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals m damage to an enemy at position p (if there are any), m\xe2\x88\x921 damage to enemies at positions p\xe2\x88\x921 and p+1, m\xe2\x88\x922 damage to enemies at positions p\xe2\x88\x922 and p+2, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of m away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.Formally, if there is an enemy at position x, she will deal max(0,m\xe2\x88\x92|p\xe2\x88\x92x|) damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different p for different attacks. Over all possible p, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least k enemies. If it is impossible to find a p such that eventually at least k enemies will be defeated, output \xe2\x88\x921 instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches 0 or below." -999
