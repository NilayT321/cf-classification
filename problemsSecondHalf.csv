In this version, q=0.A sequence of integers is called nice if its elements are arranged in blocks like in [3,3,3,4,1,1]. Formally, if two elements are equal, everything in between must also be equal.Let\'s define difficulty of a sequence as a minimum possible number of elements to change to get a nice sequence. However, if you change at least one element of value x to value y, you must also change all other elements of value x into y as well. For example, for [3,3,1,3,2,1,2] it isn\'t allowed to change first 1 to 3 and second 1 to 2. You need to leave 1\'s untouched or change them to the same value.You are given a sequence of integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an and q updates.Each update is of form ""i x""ï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 change ai to x.

The number of used colors must be minimized. For example, it\'s fine to paint elements [40,10,60] in a single color, because they are all divisible by 10. You can use any color an arbitrary amount of times (in particular, it is allowed to use a color only once). The elements painted in one color do not need to be consecutive.For example, if a=[6,2,3,4,12] then two colors are required: let\'s paint 6, 3 and 12 in the first color (6, 3 and 12 are divisible by 3) and paint 2 and 4 in the second color (2 and 4 are divisible by 2).

The road can have several crossroads, but for simplicity, we\'ll denote each crossroad as an interval (x,x+1) with integer x. So we can represent the road as a binary string consisting of n characters, where character 0 means that current interval doesn\'t contain a crossroad, and 1 means that there is a crossroad.Usually, we can install the pipeline along the road on height of 1 unit with supporting pillars in each integer point (so, if we are responsible for [0,n] road, we must install n+1 pillars). But on crossroads we should lift the pipeline up to the height 2, so the pipeline won\'t obstruct the way for cars.We can do so inserting several zig-zag-like lines. Each zig-zag can be represented as a segment [x,x+1] with integer x consisting of three parts: 0.5 units of horizontal pipe + 1 unit of vertical pipe + 0.5 of horizontal. Note that if pipeline is currently on height 2, the pillars that support it should also have length equal to 2 units.  Each unit of gas pipeline costs us a bourles, and each unit of pillar \xe2\x80\x94 b bourles. So, it\'s not always optimal to make the whole pipeline on the height 2.

The i-th vertex has mi outgoing edges that are labeled as ei[0], ei[1], \xe2\x80\xa6, ei[mi\xe2\x88\x921], each representing the destination vertex of the edge. The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The i-th vertex also has an integer ki written on itself.A travel on this graph works as follows.   Gildong chooses a vertex to start from, and an integer to start with. Set the variable c to this integer.  After arriving at the vertex i, or when Gildong begins the travel at some vertex i, add ki to c.  The next vertex is ei[x] where x is an integer 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x88\x921 satisfying x\xe2\x89\xa1c(modmi). Go to the next vertex and go back to step 2. It\'s obvious that a travel never ends, since the 2nd and the 3rd step will be repeated endlessly.For example, assume that Gildong starts at vertex 1 with c=5, and m1=2, e1[0]=1, e1[1]=2, k1=\xe2\x88\x923. Right after he starts at vertex 1, c becomes 2. Since the only integer x (0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41) where x\xe2\x89\xa1c(modmi) is 0, Gildong goes to vertex e1[0]=1. After arriving at vertex 1 again, c becomes \xe2\x88\x921. The only integer x satisfying the conditions is 1, so he goes to vertex e1[1]=2, and so on.Since Gildong is quite inquisitive, he\'s going to ask you q queries.

For each of the remaining moves she can choose from two options:  the first option, in case the box contains at least one candy, is to take exactly one candy out and eat it. This way the number of candies in the box decreased by 1;  the second option is to put candies in the box. In this case, Alya will put 1 more candy, than she put in the previous time. Thus, if the box is empty, then it can only use the second option.For example, one possible sequence of Alya\'s actions look as follows:  put one candy into the box;  put two candies into the box;  eat one candy from the box;  eat one candy from the box;  put three candies into the box;  eat one candy from the box;  put four candies into the box;  eat one candy from the box;  put five candies into the box; This way she will perform 9 actions, the number of candies at the end will be 11, while Alya will eat 4 candies in total.You know the total number of actions n and the number of candies at the end k. You need to find the total number of sweets Alya ate. That is the number of moves of the first option.

He has an app on this smartphone which contains n Japanese crosswords to solve. Adilbek has decided to solve them all one by one in the order they are listed in the app, without skipping any crossword. For each crossword, a number ti is given that represents the time it takes an average crossword expert to solve this crossword (the time is given in seconds).Adilbek is a true crossword expert, but, unfortunately, he is sometimes unlucky in choosing the way to solve the crossword. So, it takes him either ti seconds or ti+1 seconds to solve the i-th crossword, equiprobably (with probability 12 he solves the crossword in exactly ti seconds, and with probability 12 he has to spend an additional second to finish the crossword). All these events are independent.After T seconds pass (or after solving the last crossword, if he manages to do it in less than T seconds), Adilbek closes the app (if he finishes some crossword at the same moment, that crossword is considered solved; otherwise Adilbek does not finish solving the current crossword at all). He thinks it would be an interesting probability theory problem to calculate E \xe2\x80\x94 the expected number of crosswords he will be able to solve completely. Can you calculate it? Recall that the expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values \xe2\x80\x94 in this problem it means that the expected value of the number of solved crosswords can be calculated as E=n\xe2\x88\x91i=0ipi, where pi is the probability that Adilbek will solve exactly i crosswords.

Your task is to turn it into a simple polygon T that has the same area as S.You can use two tools: scissors and tape. Scissors can be used to cut any polygon into smaller polygonal pieces. Tape can be used to combine smaller pieces into larger polygons. You can use each tool multiple times, in any order. The polygons given in the input have integer coordinates, but you are allowed to produce shapes with non-integer coordinates in your output.A formal definition of the task follows.A shape Q=(Q0,\xe2\x80\xa6,Qn\xe2\x88\x921) is a sequence of three or more points in the plane such that:   The closed polyline Q0Q1Q2\xe2\x80\xa6Qn\xe2\x88\x921Q0 never touches or intersects itself, and therefore it forms the boundary of a simple polygon.  The polyline goes around the boundary of the polygon in the counter-clockwise direction. The polygon whose boundary is the shape Q will be denoted P(Q).Two shapes are called equivalent if one can be translated and/or rotated to become identical with the other.Note that mirroring a shape is not allowed. Also note that the order of points matters: the shape (Q1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Qn\xe2\x88\x921,Q0) is not necessarily equivalent to the shape (Q0,\xe2\x80\xa6,Qn\xe2\x88\x921).In the figure on the left: Shapes U and V are equivalent. Shape W is not equivalent with them because the points of W are given in a different order. Regardless of the order of points, the fourth shape is not equivalent with the previous ones either as flipping a shape is not allowed.In both input and output, a shape with n points is represented as a single line that contains 2n+1 space-separated numbers: the number n followed by the coordinates of the points: Q0,x, Q0,y, Q1,x, ...Shapes have identification numbers (IDs). The given shape S has ID 0, the shapes you produce in your solutions are given IDs 1, 2, 3, ..., in the order in which they are produced.Shapes B1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bk form a subdivision of shape A if:   The union of all P(Bi) is exactly P(A).  For each i\xe2\x89\xa0j, the area of the intersection of P(Bi) and P(Bj) is zero. The scissors operation destroys one existing shape A and produces one or more shapes B1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bk that form a subdivision of A.In the figure: Shape A (square) subdivided into shapes B1, B2, B3 (the three triangles). One valid way to describe one of the Bi is ""3 3 1 6 1 5.1 4"".The tape operation destroys one or more existing shapes A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ak and produces one new shape B. In order to perform this operation, you must first specify shapes C1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ck and only then the final shape B. These shapes must satisfy the following:   For each i, the shape Ci is equivalent to the shape Ai.  The shapes C1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ck form a subdivision of the shape B. Informally, you choose the shape B and show how to move each of the existing Ai to its correct location Ci within B. Note that only the shape B gets a new ID, the shapes Ci do not." -999

Your task is to find an order in which they can be built while satisfying the rules listed below.  The building crew has only one crane, so the Metropolis has to be constructed one skyscraper at a time.  The first skyscraper can be built anywhere on the grid.  Each subsequent skyscraper has to share a side or a corner with at least one of the previously built skyscrapers (so that it\'s easier to align the new skyscraper to the grid properly).  When building a skyscraper, there has to be a way to deliver material to the construction site from the outside of Metropolis by only moving it through empty cells that share a side.

All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, \xe2\x80\xa6, 9m, 1p, 2p, \xe2\x80\xa6, 9p, 1s, 2s, \xe2\x80\xa6, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] \xe2\x80\x94 it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] \xe2\x80\x94 it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] \xe2\x80\x94 it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite." 1200

The above-mentioned n can be any integer.These 4 categories ordered from highest to lowest as A>B>C>D, which means category A is the highest and category D is the lowest.While playing the game, players can increase the HP of the character. Now, Tokitsukaze wants you to increase her HP by at most 2 (that is, either by 0, 1 or 2). How much should she increase her HP so that it has the highest possible category?" 800

Although they try to escape, they have no place to go after they find that the door has been locked.At this very moment, CJB, Father of Tokitsukaze comes. With his magical power given by Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld, CJB is able to set m barriers to protect them from the explosion. Formally, let\'s build a Cartesian coordinate system on the plane and assume the bomb is at O(0,0). There are n persons in Tokitsukaze\'s crew, the i-th one of whom is at Pi(Xi,Yi). Every barrier can be considered as a line with infinity length and they can intersect each other. For every person from Tokitsukaze\'s crew, there must be at least one barrier separating the bomb and him, which means the line between the bomb and him intersects with at least one barrier. In this definition, if there exists a person standing at the position of the bomb, any line through O(0,0) will satisfy the requirement.Although CJB is very powerful, he still wants his barriers to be as far from the bomb as possible, in order to conserve his energy.

1190B "Tokitsukaze, CSL and Stone Game" games "Tokitsukaze and CSL are playing a little game of stones.In the beginning, there are n piles of stones, the i-th pile of which has ai stones. The two players take turns making moves. Tokitsukaze moves first. On each turn the player chooses a nonempty pile and removes exactly one stone from the pile. A player loses if all of the piles are empty before his turn, or if after removing the stone, two piles (possibly empty) contain the same number of stones. Supposing that both players play optimally, who will win the game?Consider an example: n=3 and sizes of piles are a1=2, a2=3, a3=0. It is impossible to choose the empty pile, so Tokitsukaze has two choices: the first and the second piles. If she chooses the first pile then the state will be [1,3,0] and it is a good move. But if she chooses the second pile then the state will be [2,2,0] and she immediately loses. So the only good move for her is to choose the first pile. Supposing that both players always take their best moves and never make mistakes, who will win the game?Note that even if there are two piles with the same number of stones at the beginning, Tokitsukaze may still be able to make a valid first move. It is only necessary that there are no two piles with the same number of stones after she moves." 1800

1190A "Tokitsukaze and Discard Items" "implementation,two pointers" "Recently, Tokitsukaze found an interesting game. Tokitsukaze had n items at the beginning of this game. However, she thought there were too many items, so now she wants to discard m (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n) special items of them.These n items are marked with indices from 1 to n. In the beginning, the item with index i is placed on the i-th position. Items are divided into several pages orderly, such that each page contains exactly k positions and the last positions on the last page may be left empty.Tokitsukaze would do the following operation: focus on the first special page that contains at least one special item, and at one time, Tokitsukaze would discard all special items on this page. After an item is discarded or moved, its old position would be empty, and then the item below it, if exists, would move up to this empty position. The movement may bring many items forward and even into previous pages, so Tokitsukaze would keep waiting until all the items stop moving, and then do the operation (i.e. check the special page and discard the special items) repeatedly until there is no item need to be discarded.  Consider the first example from the statement: n=10, m=4, k=5, p=[3,5,7,10]. The are two pages. Initially, the first page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). So Tokitsukaze discards the special items with indices 3 and 5. After, the first page remains to be special. It contains [1,2,4,6,7], Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index 7. After, the second page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). It contains [9,10], Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index 10. Tokitsukaze wants to know the number of operations she would do in total." 1400

1189C Candies! "data structures,dp,implementation,math" "Consider a sequence of digits of length 2k [a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2k]. We perform the following operation with it: replace pairs (a2i+1,a2i+2) with (a2i+1+a2i+2)mod10 for 0\xe2\x89\xa4i<2k\xe2\x88\x921. For every i where a2i+1+a2i+2\xe2\x89\xa510 we get a candy! As a result, we will get a sequence of length 2k\xe2\x88\x921.Less formally, we partition sequence of length 2k into 2k\xe2\x88\x921 pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth \xe2\x80\xa6, the last pair consists of the (2k\xe2\x88\x921)-th and (2k)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least 10, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by 10 (and don\'t change the order of the numbers).Perform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length 1. Let f([a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2k]) denote the number of candies we get in this process. For example: if the starting sequence is [8,7,3,1,7,0,9,4] then:After the first operation the sequence becomes [(8+7)mod10,(3+1)mod10,(7+0)mod10,(9+4)mod10] = [5,4,7,3], and we get 2 candies as 8+7\xe2\x89\xa510 and 9+4\xe2\x89\xa510.After the second operation the sequence becomes [(5+4)mod10,(7+3)mod10] = [9,0], and we get one more candy as 7+3\xe2\x89\xa510. After the final operation sequence becomes [(9+0)mod10] = [9]. Therefore, f([8,7,3,1,7,0,9,4])=3 as we got 3 candies in total.You are given a sequence of digits of length n s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6sn.

1189A "Keanu Reeves" strings "After playing Neo in the legendary ""Matrix"" trilogy, Keanu Reeves started doubting himself: maybe we really live in virtual reality? To find if this is true, he needs to solve the following problem.Let\'s call a string consisting of only zeroes and ones good if it contains different numbers of zeroes and ones. For example, 1, 101, 0000 are good, while 01, 1001, and 111000 are not good.We are given a string s of length n consisting of only zeroes and ones. We need to cut s into minimal possible number of substrings s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk such that all of them are good. More formally, we have to find minimal by number of strings sequence of good strings s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk such that their concatenation (joining) equals s, i.e. s1+s2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+sk=s.For example, cuttings 110010 into 110 and 010 or into 11 and 0010 are valid, as 110, 010, 11, 0010 are all good, and we can\'t cut 110010 to the smaller number of substrings as 110010 isn\'t good itself. At the same time, cutting of 110010 into 1100 and 10 isn\'t valid as both strings aren\'t good. Also, cutting of 110010 into 1, 1, 0010 isn\'t valid, as it isn\'t minimal, even though all 3 strings are good.Can you help Keanu? We can show that the solution always exists. If there are multiple optimal answers, print any." 800

He takes a rectangular checkered sheet of paper of size n\xc3\x97m (where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns) and starts to draw snakes in cells.Polycarp draws snakes with lowercase Latin letters. He always draws the first snake with the symbol \'a\', the second snake with the symbol \'b\', the third snake with the symbol \'c\' and so on. All snakes have their own unique symbol. There are only 26 letters in the Latin alphabet, Polycarp is very tired and he doesn\'t want to invent new symbols, so the total number of drawn snakes doesn\'t exceed 26.Since by the end of the week Polycarp is very tired, he draws snakes as straight lines without bends. So each snake is positioned either vertically or horizontally. Width of any snake equals 1, i.e. each snake has size either 1\xc3\x97l or l\xc3\x971, where l is snake\'s length. Note that snakes can\'t bend.When Polycarp draws a new snake, he can use already occupied cells for drawing the snake. In this situation, he draws the snake ""over the top"" and overwrites the previous value in the cell.Recently when Polycarp was at work he found a checkered sheet of paper with Latin letters.

Let\'s denote l as the current length of the multiverse. With a probability of pcreate=1\xe2\x88\x92lm, a universe will be created. With a probability of pbreak=lm, a non-existent link will be broken at some position.More specifically,   When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. Each position occurs with a probability of 1l+1.   When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes, each with a probability of 1l\xe2\x88\x921. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. As earlier, the Doctor remains in the same universe. However, if at some point the multiverse breaks in such a way that the Doctor finds himself at the leftmost or rightmost end of it, the TARDIS stops functioning.In such a case, the Doctor must actually walk across the multiverse to find the tools to fix it.We are interested in the expected value of the length of the multiverse when such an event occurs." 3100

For each ring, n points are uniformly sampled with a small random noise. The task is to recover the rings given only the noisy samples.The rings and the samples are generated as follows. The center of a ring is uniformly sampled from a disk of radius 1000000 centered at the origin, and the radius of the ring is uniformly sampled from [250000,750000]. Let R be a ring with center (x,y) and radius r. To sample a point from R, an angle \xce\xb8 is uniformly sampled from [0,2\xcf\x80] and a distance d is uniformly sampled from [0.9r,1.1r]. The coordinates of the sampled point are then (x+dcos(\xce\xb8),y+dsin(\xce\xb8)) rounded to the closest integers.The distance between rings is measured by their Hausdorff distance. In our case, the distance between two rings R1,R2 can be written as follow. Let d be the distance between the two centers and r1,r2 be the radii. Then the distance is dist(R1,R2)=max(min(d\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92,d\xe2\x88\x92+),min(d+\xe2\x88\x92,d++),min(d\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92,d+\xe2\x88\x92),min(d\xe2\x88\x92+,d++)), where d++=|d+r1+r2|, d+\xe2\x88\x92=|d+r1\xe2\x88\x92r2|, d\xe2\x88\x92+=|d\xe2\x88\x92r1+r2|, d\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92=|d\xe2\x88\x92r1\xe2\x88\x92r2|.We say that a ring R0 is recovered if one of the rings R in the output has Hausdorff distance less than 100000 from R0. An output is accepted if all the rings are recovered.

Two names can be interchanged only if using the following hashing function on them results in a collision. However, the hashing function is parametrized, so one can always find a set of parameters that causes such a collision. Heidi decided to exploit this to her advantage.Given two strings w1, w2 of equal length n consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer m.Consider the standard polynomial hashing function:Hp(w):=(\xe2\x88\x91|w|\xe2\x88\x921i=0wiri)mod(p)where p is some prime, and r is some number such that 2\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x88\x922.The goal is to find r and a prime p (m\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4109) such that Hp(w1)=Hp(w2).Strings w1 and w2 are sampled independently at random from all strings of length n over lowercase English letters." 3100

In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques.The first hashing function she designed is as follows.Given two positive integers (x,y) she defines H(x,y):=x2+2xy+x+1.Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible. That is, given a positive integer r, can you find a pair (x,y) (of positive integers) such that H(x,y)=r?If multiple such pairs exist, output the one with smallest possible x.

Suppose Sasha has 5 chizhiks, Masha has 4 chizhiks, and the price for one coconut be 3 chizhiks. If the girls don\'t exchange with chizhiks, they will buy 1+1=2 coconuts.

But, he doesn\'t want to tell Tolik about his inability to solve it, so he hasn\'t found anything better than asking you how to solve this task.In this task you are given a cell field n\xe2\x8b\x85m, consisting of n rows and m columns, where point\'s coordinates (x,y) mean it is situated in the x-th row and y-th column, considering numeration from one (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4m). Initially, you stand in the cell (1,1). Every move you can jump from cell (x,y), which you stand in, by any non-zero vector (dx,dy), thus you will stand in the (x+dx,y+dy) cell. Obviously, you can\'t leave the field, but also there is one more important conditionï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 you\'re not allowed to use one vector twice. Your task is to visit each cell of the field exactly once (the initial cell is considered as already visited).Tolik\'s uncle is a very respectful person. Help him to solve this task!" 1800

1179A "Valeriy and Deque" "data structures,implementation" "Recently, on the course of algorithms and data structures, Valeriy learned how to use a deque. He built a deque filled with n elements. The i-th element is ai (i = 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n). He gradually takes the first two leftmost elements from the deque (let\'s call them A and B, respectively), and then does the following: if A>B, he writes A to the beginning and writes B to the end of the deque, otherwise, he writes to the beginning B, and A writes to the end of the deque. We call this sequence of actions an operation.For example, if deque was [2,3,4,5,1], on the operation he will write B=3 to the beginning and A=2 to the end, so he will get [3,4,5,1,2].The teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him q queries. Each query consists of the singular number mj (j=1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,q). It is required for each query to answer which two elements he will pull out on the mj-th operation.Note that the queries are independent and for each query the numbers A and B should be printed in the order in which they will be pulled out of the deque.Deque is a data structure representing a list of elements where insertion of new elements or deletion of existing elements can be made from both sides." 1500

Bob would type it as ""vvvv"", but this string actually contains three occurrences of ""w"":   ""vvvv""  ""vvvv""  ""vvvv"" For example, the wow factor of the word ""vvvovvv"" equals to four because there are four wows:  ""vvvovvv""  ""vvvovvv""  ""vvvovvv""  ""vvvovvv"" Note that the subsequence ""vvvovvv"" does not count towards the wow factor, as the ""v""s have to be consecutive.For a given string s, compute and output its wow factor.

1178A "Prime Minister" greedy "Alice is the leader of the State Refactoring Party, and she is about to become the prime minister. The elections have just taken place. There are n parties, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th party has received ai seats in the parliament.Alice\'s party has number 1. In order to become the prime minister, she needs to build a coalition, consisting of her party and possibly some other parties. There are two conditions she needs to fulfil:   The total number of seats of all parties in the coalition must be a strict majority of all the seats, i.e. it must have strictly more than half of the seats. For example, if the parliament has 200 (or 201) seats, then the majority is 101 or more seats.  Alice\'s party must have at least 2 times more seats than any other party in the coalition. For example, to invite a party with 50 seats, Alice\'s party must have at least 100 seats. For example, if n=4 and a=[51,25,99,25] (note that Alice\'a party has 51 seats), then the following set [a1=51,a2=25,a4=25] can create a coalition since both conditions will be satisfied. However, the following sets will not create a coalition:  [a2=25,a3=99,a4=25] since Alice\'s party is not there;  [a1=51,a2=25] since coalition should have a strict majority;  [a1=51,a2=25,a3=99] since Alice\'s party should have at least 2 times more seats than any other party in the coalition. Alice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition. If she wants, she can invite as many parties as she wants (as long as the conditions are satisfied). If Alice\'s party has enough people to create a coalition on her own, she can invite no parties.Note that Alice can either invite a party as a whole or not at all. It is not possible to invite only some of the deputies (seats) from another party. In other words, if Alice invites a party, she invites all its deputies.Find and print any suitable coalition." 800

This method should support the transmission of an arbitrary number of integer sequences; sequences can have different lengths. The sequences contain arbitrary non-negative integers.Polycarp developed the following encoding procedure:  We assume that the sequences are numbered from 1 to n.  We add a special terminating marker to each sequence at the end, an element equal to -1.  The encoding result is a new single sequence that contains all the elements of the specified n in a special order: first, add to the result of coding all the first elements of the sequences (in the order from the 1-st to the n-th), then all the second elements (in the order from the 1-st to the n-th) and so on, if the sequence does not have the corresponding element, then it is simply skipped. The process ends when all elements of all sequences are added.

Luckily, we came up with a similar-looking scene which was a tiny bit cheaper to make.Firstly, forget about 3D, that\'s hard and expensive! The city is now represented as a number line (infinite to make it easier, of course).Secondly, the city doesn\'t have to look natural at all. There are nn buildings on the line. Each building is a square 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971. Buildings are numbered from 11 to nn in ascending order of their positions. Lower corners of building ii are at integer points aiai and ai+1ai+1 of the number line. Also the distance between any two neighbouring buildings ii and i+1i+1 doesn\'t exceed dd (really, this condition is here just to make the city look not that sparse). Distance between some neighbouring buildings ii and i+1i+1 is calculated from the lower right corner of building ii to the lower left corner of building i+1i+1.Finally, curvature of the bend is also really hard to simulate!

Take the ray from xx to +\xe2\x88\x9e+\xe2\x88\x9e and all the buildings which are on this ray and start turning the ray and the buildings counter-clockwise around point xx.

Locations are numbered from 1 to n in input order.  workï¿½(start-moment)ï¿½(end-moment)ï¿½(at-location)We want the worker to do the job at this location in this exact time interval. The location must be equal to the location in the previous arrival command. If the worker can not make it in time after the previous command, or the given time interval has wrong length or exceeds the time span of the location, the solution is considered incorrect. This command must be present at least once in each block. Recall that each job must be either completed simultaneously by the required number of workers, or left untouched, otherwise, the solution will be considered incorrect.  endThe last line of a block. The worker must be in the same position where he started. At each moment, there may be arbitrarily many workers in each location.

It is included for explanatory purposes only.ScoringEach test is scored independently. The score for a test is the profit divided by 1000. It the profit is negative, the score is equal to zero. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is also zero.TestingYour solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. A solution\'s score is the sum of its results on all the tests. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is zero.During the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to submit a solution.  The first one, problem A1, is to check on examples. There are 10 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result. The tests for A1 are open, you can download them from the links https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.tar.gz (for Linux) and https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.zip (for Windows). After testing, you can click the verdict of your submission to see the result for each test.  The second way, problem A2, is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. After the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing;  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero;  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. Note that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.During final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same set of a large number (\xe2\x89\x881000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place." -999

The ii-th number represents a type of the ii-th figure:  circle;  isosceles triangle with the length of height equal to the length of base;  square. The figures of the given sequence are placed somewhere on a Cartesian plane in such a way that:  (i+1)(i+1)-th figure is inscribed into the ii-th one;  each triangle base is parallel to OX;  the triangle is oriented in such a way that the vertex opposite to its base is at the top;  each square sides are parallel to the axes;  for each ii from 22 to nn figure ii has the maximum possible length of side for triangle and square and maximum radius for circle. Note that the construction is unique for some fixed position and size of just the first figure.The task is to calculate the number of distinct points (not necessarily with integer coordinates) where figures touch.

A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. A parent of a node vv is the last different from vv vertex on the path from the root to the vertex vv. Children of vertex vv are all nodes for which vv is the parent. A vertex is a leaf if it has no children.The rooted tree Serval owns has nn nodes, node 11 is the root.

For example, parenthesis sequences ""()()"", ""(())"" are correct (the resulting expressions are: ""(1+1)+(1+1)"", ""((1+1)+1)""), while "")("" and "")"" are not. Note that the empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence by definition.We define that |s| as the length of string s.

A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal 2m\xe2\x88\x921 for some non-negative integer m. For example, the numbers 0, 1, 3, 7, 15 and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on x:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer n and replace x with x\xe2\x8a\x95(2n\xe2\x88\x921), with \xe2\x8a\x95 being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace x with x+1. The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most 40 operations.

Let\'s sort all the inadequate integers. Let \xe2\x8c\x8ax/10\xe2\x8c\x8b have number k in this order. Then, the integer x is inadequate only if the last digit of x is strictly less than the reminder of division of k by 11. Here \xe2\x8c\x8ax/10\xe2\x8c\x8b denotes x/10 rounded down.Thus, if x is the m-th in increasing order inadequate number, and m gives the remainder c when divided by 11, then integers 10\xe2\x8b\x85x+0,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+1\xe2\x80\xa6,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+(c\xe2\x88\x921) are inadequate, while integers 10\xe2\x8b\x85x+c,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+(c+1),\xe2\x80\xa6,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+9 are not inadequate.The first several inadequate integers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,21,30,31,32\xe2\x80\xa6. After that, since 4 is the fourth inadequate integer, 40,41,42,43 are inadequate, while 44,45,46,\xe2\x80\xa6,49 are not inadequate; since 10 is the 10-th inadequate number, integers 100,101,102,\xe2\x80\xa6,109 are all inadequate.

There is exactly one coin under every manhole, and to win the game Nastya should pick all the coins. Initially Nastya stands near the kk-th manhole from the left. She is thinking what to do.In one turn, Nastya can do one of the following:   if there is at least one stone on the manhole Nastya stands near, throw exactly one stone from it onto any other manhole (yes, Nastya is strong).  go to a neighboring manhole;  if there are no stones on the manhole Nastya stays near, she can open it and pick the coin from it. After it she must close the manhole immediately (it doesn\'t require additional moves).   The figure shows the intermediate state of the game. At the current position Nastya can throw the stone to any other manhole or move left or right to the neighboring manholes. If she were near the leftmost manhole, she could open it (since there are no stones on it). Nastya can leave the room when she picks all the coins.

To do this, the shark can push any domino to the left or to the right, and it will begin falling in this direction. If during the fall the domino touches other dominoes, they will also start falling in the same direction in which the original domino is falling, thus beginning a chain reaction, as a result of which many dominoes can fall. A falling domino touches another one, if and only if the distance between them was strictly less than the height of the falling domino, the dominoes do not necessarily have to be adjacent.Of course, any shark can easily drop all the dominoes in this way, so the goal is not to drop all the dominoes, but do it with a minimum cost. The cost of the destruction is the sum of the costs of dominoes that the shark needs to push to make all the dominoes fall.Simon has already won in the previous subjects, but is not smart enough to win in this one.

For example, the product of strings ""abc"" and ""de"" is a string ""deadebdecde"", while the product of the strings ""ab"" and ""z"" is a string ""zazbz"". Note, that unlike the numbers multiplication, the product of strings s and t is not necessarily equal to product of t and s.Roman was jealous of Denis, since he invented such a cool operation, and hence decided to invent something string-related too. Since Roman is beauty-lover, he decided to define the beauty of the string as the length of the longest substring, consisting of only one letter. For example, the beauty of the string ""xayyaaabca"" is equal to 3, since there is a substring ""aaa"", while the beauty of the string ""qwerqwer"" is equal to 1, since all neighboring symbols in it are different.In order to entertain Roman, Denis wrote down n strings p1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn on the paper and asked him to calculate the beauty of the string (\xe2\x80\xa6(((p1\xe2\x8b\x85p2)\xe2\x8b\x85p3)\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6)\xe2\x8b\x85pn, where s\xe2\x8b\x85t denotes a multiplication of strings s and t.

In particular, each string of ""0"" and/or ""1"" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: ""0011"", ""0101"", ""1110"", and ""1111"".You will work with a string S, which is initially empty. For m times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to S, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo 109+7." 2400

Then they applied a sequence of no more than n (possibly zero) operations. i-th operation is denoted by two integers ai and bi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n), and means swapping two elements of the string with indices ai and bi. All operations were done in the order they were placed in the sequence. For example, if s is xyz and 2 following operations are performed: a1=1,b1=2; a2=2,b2=3, then after the first operation the current string is yxz, and after the second operation the current string is yzx, so t is yzx.You are asked to restore the original string s. Unfortunately, you have no information about the operations used in the algorithm (you don\'t even know if there were any operations in the sequence).

Kefa determines the beauty of a tree as follows: he finds in the tree his two favorite verticesï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 vertices with numbers aa and bb, and counts the distance between them. The distance between two vertices xx and yy is the sum of weights of edges on the simple path from xx to yy.

1109B "Sasha and One More Name" "constructive algorithms,hashing,strings" "Reading books is one of Sasha\'s passions. Once while he was reading one book, he became acquainted with an unusual character. The character told about himself like that: ""Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir among the Elves, Thark\xc3\xbbn to the Dwarves, Ol\xc3\xb3rin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Inc\xc3\xa1nus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.""And at that moment Sasha thought, how would that character be called in the East? In the East all names are palindromes. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, such strings as ""kazak"", ""oo"" and ""r"" are palindromes, but strings ""abb"" and ""ij"" are not. Sasha believed that the hero would be named after one of the gods of the East. As long as there couldn\'t be two equal names, so in the East people did the following: they wrote the original name as a string on a piece of paper, then cut the paper minimum number of times k, so they got k+1 pieces of paper with substrings of the initial string, and then unite those pieces together to get a new string. Pieces couldn\'t be turned over, they could be shuffled.In this way, it\'s possible to achive a string abcdefg from the string f|de|abc|g using 3 cuts (by swapping papers with substrings f and abc). The string cbadefg can\'t be received using the same cuts.More formally, Sasha wants for the given palindrome s find such minimum k, that you can cut this string into k+1 parts, and then unite them in such a way that the final string will be a palindrome and it won\'t be equal to the initial string s. It there is no answer, then print ""Impossible"" (without quotes)." 1800

It is also possible that the rook would move onto the same square it was before and the position wouldn\'t change. However, she can\'t move the rook on the same row or column with the king.Each player makes 2000 turns, if the white king wasn\'t checked by a black rook during those turns, black wins.

Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.For example, consider the following string:   This string can encode the message \xc2\xabhappynewyear\xc2\xbb.

When two eels fight, the big one eats the smaller one (if their weights are equal, then one of them will still eat the other). Namely, let n eels be initially in an aquarium, and the i-th of them have a weight of xi. Then n\xe2\x88\x921 battles will occur between them, as a result of which, only one eel will survive. In a battle of two eels with weights a and b, where a\xe2\x89\xa4b, eel of weight a will be eaten and disappear from the aquarium, and eel of weight b will increase its weight to a+b.A battle between two eels with weights a and b, where a\xe2\x89\xa4b, is considered dangerous if b\xe2\x89\xa42a.

In the k-th step, k\xe2\x89\xa51, we define the sequence Mk to be the concatenation of the d copies of Mk\xe2\x88\x921. However, each of them is altered slightly \xe2\x80\x94 in the i-th of them (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4d), each element x is changed to (x+geni)(modm).

As you can see, as long as the first element of gen is 0, each consecutive step produces a sequence whose prefix is the sequence generated in the previous step. Therefore, we can define the infinite Thorse-Radewoosh sequence M\xe2\x88\x9e as the sequence obtained by applying the step above indefinitely. For the parameters above, M\xe2\x88\x9e=(0,1,2,1,2,3,2,3,0,1,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6).Mateusz picked a sequence gen and an integer m, and used them to obtain a Thorse-Radewoosh sequence M\xe2\x88\x9e.

1097C "Yuhao and a Parenthesis" greedy,implementation "One day, Yuhao came across a problem about checking if some bracket sequences are correct bracket sequences.A bracket sequence is any non-empty sequence of opening and closing parentheses. A bracket sequence is called a correct bracket sequence if it\'s possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters ""+"" and ""1"" into this sequence. For example, the sequences ""(())()"", ""()"" and ""(()(()))"" are correct, while the bracket sequences "")("", ""(()"" and ""(()))("" are not correct.Yuhao found this problem too simple for him so he decided to make the problem harder. You are given many (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences. The task is to connect some of them into ordered pairs so that each bracket sequence occurs in at most one pair and the concatenation of the bracket sequences in each pair is a correct bracket sequence. The goal is to create as many pairs as possible.This problem unfortunately turned out to be too difficult for Yuhao. Can you help him and solve it?" 1400

The i-th rotation should be ai degrees, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and after all n rotations the pointer should again point at zero.This confused Petr a little bit as he isn\'t sure which rotations should be done clockwise and which should be done counterclockwise.

He may remove some characters from the statement in order to make it easy. But, of course, some parts of the statement can be crucial to understanding. Initially the ambiguity of the statement is 0, and removing i-th character increases the ambiguity by ai (the index of each character is considered as it was in the original statement, so, for example, if you delete character r from hard, and then character d, the index of d is still 4 even though you delete it from the string had).Vasya wants to calculate the minimum ambiguity of the statement, if he removes some characters (possibly zero) so that the statement is easy.

Before the game starts and after every move, the following two conditions must hold:   Any two tokens are not in the same cell.  In each row, the blue token is to the left of the white token, and the red token is to the right of the white token. First, they pick a positive integer f, whose value is valid for the whole game. Second, the starting player is chosen and makes his or her first turn. Then players take alternating turns. The player who is unable to make a move loses. During a move, a player first selects an integer k that is either a prime number or a product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes. The smallest possible values of k are thus 2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,\xe2\x80\xa6. Furthermore, k must not be equal to the previously picked integer f. Each turn, a move is performed in exactly one of the rows.If it is Alice\'s turn, she chooses a single blue token and moves it k cells to the right. Alternatively, she may move both the blue and the white token in the same row by the same amount k to the right.On the other hand, Bob selects a single red token and moves it k cells to the left. Similarly, he may also move the white and the red token in the corresponding row by k to the left.Note that Alice may never move a red token, while Bob may never move a blue one. Remember that after a move, the two conditions on relative positions of the tokens must still hold. Both players play optimally.

Bob is located to the left of the first segment, while Alice\'s nest is on the right of the last segment. Each segment has a length in meters, and also terrain type: grass, water or lava. Bob has three movement types: swimming, walking and flying. He can switch between them or change his direction at any point in time (even when he is located at a non-integer coordinate), and doing so doesn\'t require any extra time. Bob can swim only on the water, walk only on the grass and fly over any terrain. Flying one meter takes 11 second, swimming one meter takes 33 seconds, and finally walking one meter takes 55 seconds.Bob has a finite amount of energy, called stamina. Swimming and walking is relaxing for him, so he gains 11 stamina for every meter he walks or swims. On the other hand, flying is quite tiring, and he spends 11 stamina for every meter flown. Staying in place does not influence his stamina at all. Of course, his stamina can never become negative. Initially, his stamina is zero.What is the shortest possible time in which he can reach Alice\'s nest?" 2600

Can you help him?As everyone knows, the world is a two-dimensional plane. The i-th obelisk is at integer coordinates (xi,yi). The j-th clue consists of 2 integers (aj,bj) and belongs to the obelisk pj, where p is some (unknown) permutation on n elements. It means that the treasure is located at T=(xpj+aj,ypj+bj). This point T is the same for all clues.In other words, each clue belongs to exactly one of the obelisks, and each obelisk has exactly one clue that belongs to it. A clue represents the vector from the obelisk to the treasure. The clues must be distributed among the obelisks in such a way that they all point to the same position of the treasure.Your task is to find the coordinates of the treasure. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.Note that you don\'t need to find the permutation. Permutations are used only in order to explain the problem." 1200

1089J "JS Minification" greedy,implementation "International Coding Procedures Company (ICPC) writes all its code in Jedi Script (JS) programming language. JS does not get compiled, but is delivered for execution in its source form. Sources contain comments, extra whitespace (including trailing and leading spaces), and other non-essential features that make them quite large but do not contribute to the semantics of the code, so the process of minification is performed on source files before their delivery to execution to compress sources while preserving their semantics.You are hired by ICPC to write JS minifier for ICPC. Fortunately, ICPC adheres to very strict programming practices and their JS sources are quite restricted in grammar. They work only on integer algorithms and do not use floating point numbers and strings. Every JS source contains a sequence of lines. Each line contains zero or more tokens that can be separated by spaces. On each line, a part of the line that starts with a hash character (\'#\' code 35), including the hash character itself, is treated as a comment and is ignored up to the end of the line.Each line is parsed into a sequence of tokens from left to right by repeatedly skipping spaces and finding the longest possible token starting at the current parsing position, thus transforming the source code into a sequence of tokens. All the possible tokens are listed below:  A reserved token is any kind of operator, separator, literal, reserved word, or a name of a library function that should be preserved during the minification process. Reserved tokens are fixed strings of non-space ASCII characters that do not contain the hash character (\'#\' code 35). All reserved tokens are given as an input to the minification process.  A number token consists of a sequence of digits, where a digit is a character from zero (\'0\') to nine (\'9\') inclusive.  A word token consists of a sequence of characters from the following set: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, underscore (\'_\' code 95), and dollar sign (\'$\' code 36). A word does not start with a digit. Note, that during parsing the longest sequence of characters that satisfies either a number or a word definition, but that appears in the list of reserved tokens, is considered to be a reserved token instead.During the minification process words are renamed in a systematic fashion using the following algorithm:  Take a list of words that consist only of lowercase letters ordered first by their length, then lexicographically: ""a"", ""b"", ..., ""z"", ""aa"", ""ab"", ..., excluding reserved tokens, since they are not considered to be words. This is the target word list.  Rename the first word encountered in the input token sequence to the first word in the target word list and all further occurrences of the same word in the input token sequence, too. Rename the second new word encountered in the input token sequence to the second word in the target word list, and so on. The goal of the minification process is to convert the given source to the shortest possible line (counting spaces) that still parses to the same sequence of tokens with the correspondingly renamed words using these JS parsing rules." 3200

He has got one new task, paint some bricks in the yard.There are nn bricks lined in a row on the ground. Chouti has got mm paint buckets of different colors at hand, so he painted each brick in one of those mm colors.Having finished painting all bricks, Chouti was satisfied. He stood back and decided to find something fun with these bricks. After some counting, he found there are kk bricks with a color different from the color of the brick on its left (the first brick is not counted, for sure).So as usual, he needs your help in counting how many ways could he paint the bricks. Two ways of painting bricks are different if there is at least one brick painted in different colors in these two ways. Because the answer might be quite big, you only need to output the number of ways modulo 998244353998244353." 1500

Therefore, she asked Olya to perform exactly k splitting operations.A Splitting operation is an operation during which Olya takes a square with side a and cuts it into 4 equal squares with side a2. If the side of the square is equal to 1, then it is impossible to apply a splitting operation to it (see examples for better understanding).Olya is happy to fulfill her sister\'s request, but she also wants the condition of Olya\'s happiness to be satisfied after all operations.The condition of Olya\'s happiness will be satisfied if the following statement is fulfilled:Let the length of the side of the lower left square be equal to a, then the length of the side of the right upper square should also be equal to a. There should also be a path between them that consists only of squares with the side of length a. All consecutive squares on a path should have a common side.Obviously, as long as we have one square, these conditions are met. So Olya is ready to fulfill her sister\'s request only under the condition that she is satisfied too. Tell her: is it possible to perform exactly k splitting operations in a certain order so that the condition of Olya\'s happiness is satisfied?

1078E "Negative Time Summation" "constructive algorithms" "Everyone knows that computers become faster and faster. Recently Berland scientists have built a machine that can move itself back in time!More specifically, it works as follows. It has an infinite grid and a robot which stands on one of the cells. Each cell of the grid can either be empty or contain 0 or 1. The machine also has a program which consists of instructions, which are being handled one by one. Each instruction is represented by exactly one symbol (letter or digit) and takes exactly one unit of time (say, second) to be performed, except the last type of operation (it\'s described below). Here they are:  0 or 1: the robot places this number into the cell he is currently at. If this cell wasn\'t empty before the operation, its previous number is replaced anyway.  e: the robot erases the number into the cell he is at.  l, r, u or d: the robot goes one cell to the left/right/up/down.  s: the robot stays where he is for a unit of time.  t: let x be 0, if the cell with the robot is empty, otherwise let x be one more than the digit in this cell (that is, x=1 if the digit in this cell is 0, and x=2 if the digit is 1). Then the machine travels x seconds back in time. Note that this doesn\'t change the instructions order, but it changes the position of the robot and the numbers in the grid as they were x units of time ago. You can consider this instruction to be equivalent to a Ctrl-Z pressed x times. For example, let the board be completely empty, and the program be sr1t0. Let the robot initially be at (0,0).  [now is the moment 0, the command is s]: we do nothing.  [now is the moment 1, the command is r]: we are now at (1,0).  [now is the moment 2, the command is 1]: we are at (1,0), and this cell contains 1.  [now is the moment 3, the command is t]: we travel 1+1=2 moments back, that is, to the moment 1.  [now is the moment 1, the command is 0]: we are again at (0,0), and the board is clear again, but after we follow this instruction, this cell has 0 in it. We\'ve just rewritten the history. The consequences of the third instruction have never happened. Now Berland scientists want to use their machine in practice. For example, they want to be able to add two integers.Assume that the initial state of the machine is as follows:  One positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,1), from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit.  The other positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,0), from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit.  All the other cells are empty.  The robot is at (0,0).  We consider this state to be always in the past; that is, if you manage to travel to any negative moment, the board was always as described above, and the robot was at (0,0) for eternity. You are asked to write a program after which  The robot stands on a non-empty cell,  If we read the number starting from the cell with the robot and moving to the right until the first empty cell, this will be a+b in binary, from the highest bit to the lowest bit. Note that there are no restrictions on other cells. In particular, there may be a digit just to the left to the robot after all instructions.In each test you are given up to 1000 pairs (a,b), and your program must work for all these pairs. Also since the machine\'s memory is not very big, your program must consist of no more than 105 instructions." 3400

Each booth has an unlimited supply of candies.Polycarp has decided to spend at most T burles at the fair. However, he has some plan in mind for his path across the booths:  at first, he visits booth number 1;  if he has enough burles to buy exactly one candy from the current booth, then he buys it immediately;  then he proceeds to the next booth in the clockwise order (regardless of if he bought a candy or not). Polycarp\'s money is finite, thus the process will end once he can no longer buy candy at any booth.Calculate the number of candies Polycarp will buy." 1700

1073C "Vasya and Robot" "binary search,two pointers" "Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell (0,0). Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U \xe2\x80\x94 move from (x,y) to (x,y+1);  D \xe2\x80\x94 move from (x,y) to (x,y\xe2\x88\x921);  L \xe2\x80\x94 move from (x,y) to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y);  R \xe2\x80\x94 move from (x,y) to (x+1,y). Vasya also has got a sequence of n operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in (x,y).Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: maxID\xe2\x88\x92minID+1, where maxID is the maximum index of a changed operation, and minID is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices 2, 5 and 7 are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is 7\xe2\x88\x922+1=6. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is 1. If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is 0. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can\'t insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from (0,0) to (x,y), or tell him that it\'s impossible." 1800

The book at the bottom of the stack has number an. All numbers are distinct.Vasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in n steps. During i-th step he wants to move the book number bi into his backpack. If the book with number bi is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book bi, and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order [1,2,3] (book 1 is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order [2,1,3], then during the first step he will move two books (1 and 2), during the second step he will do nothing (since book 1 is already in the backpack), and during the third step \xe2\x80\x94 one book (the book number 3).

1071E "Rain Protection" "binary search,geometry" "A lot of people dream of convertibles (also often called cabriolets). Some of convertibles, however, don\'t have roof at all, and are vulnerable to rain. This is why Melon Ask, the famous inventor, decided to create a rain protection mechanism for convertibles.The workplace of the mechanism is a part of plane just above the driver. Its functional part consists of two rails with sliding endpoints of a piece of stretching rope. For the sake of simplicity we can consider this as a pair of parallel segments in a plane with the rope segment, whose endpoints we are free to choose as any points on these rails segments.  The algorithmic part of the mechanism detects each particular raindrop and predicts when and where it reaches the plane. At this exact moment the rope segment must contain the raindrop point (so the rope adsorbs the raindrop).You are given the initial position of the rope endpoints and all information about raindrops. You are to choose the minimal possible speed vv of the endpoints sliding (both endpoints can slide in any direction along their segments independently of each other) in such a way that it is possible to catch all raindrops moving both endpoints with speed not greater than v, or find out that it\'s impossible no matter how high the speed is." 3500

1070M "Algoland and Berland" "constructive algorithms,divide and conquer,geometry" "Once upon a time Algoland and Berland were a single country, but those times are long gone. Now they are two different countries, but their cities are scattered on a common territory.All cities are represented as points on the Cartesian plane. Algoland consists of a cities numbered from 1 to a. The coordinates of the i-th Algoland city are a pair of integer numbers (xai,yai). Similarly, Berland consists of b cities numbered from 1 to b. The coordinates of the j-th Berland city are a pair of integer numbers (xbj,ybj). No three of the a+b mentioned cities lie on a single straight line.As the first step to unite the countries, Berland decided to build several bidirectional freeways. Each freeway is going to be a line segment that starts in a Berland city and ends in an Algoland city. Freeways can\'t intersect with each other at any point except freeway\'s start or end. Moreover, the freeways have to connect all a+b cities. Here, connectivity means that one can get from any of the specified a+b cities to any other of the a+b cities using freeways. Note that all freeways are bidirectional, which means that one can drive on each of them in both directions.Mayor of each of the b Berland cities allocated a budget to build the freeways that start from this city. Thus, you are given the numbers r1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rb, where rj is the number of freeways that are going to start in the j-th Berland city. The total allocated budget is very tight and only covers building the minimal necessary set of freeways. In other words, r1+r2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+rb=a+b\xe2\x88\x921.Help Berland to build the freeways so that:  each freeway is a line segment connecting a Berland city and an Algoland city,  no freeways intersect with each other except for the freeway\'s start or end,  freeways connect all a+b cities (all freeways are bidirectional),  there are rj freeways that start from the j-th Berland city." 3000

1070G "Monsters and Potions" "brute force,dp,greedy,implementation" "Polycarp is an introvert person. In fact he is so much of an introvert that he plays ""Monsters and Potions"" board game alone. The board of the game is a row of n cells. The cells are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. There are three types of cells: a cell containing a single monster, a cell containing a single potion or a blank cell (it contains neither a monster nor a potion).Polycarp has m tokens representing heroes fighting monsters, which are initially located in the blank cells s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sm. Polycarp\'s task is to choose a single cell (rally point) and one by one move all the heroes into this cell. A rally point can be a cell of any of three types.After Policarp selects a rally point, he picks a hero and orders him to move directly to the point. Once that hero reaches the point, Polycarp picks another hero and orders him also to go to the point. And so forth, until all the heroes reach the rally point cell. While going to the point, a hero can not deviate from the direct route or take a step back. A hero just moves cell by cell in the direction of the point until he reaches it. It is possible that multiple heroes are simultaneously in the same cell.Initially the i-th hero has hi hit points (HP). Monsters also have HP, different monsters might have different HP. And potions also have HP, different potions might have different HP.If a hero steps into a cell which is blank (i.e. doesn\'t contain a monster/potion), hero\'s HP does not change.If a hero steps into a cell containing a monster, then the hero and the monster fight. If monster\'s HP is strictly higher than hero\'s HP, then the monster wins and Polycarp loses the whole game. If hero\'s HP is greater or equal to monster\'s HP, then the hero wins and monster\'s HP is subtracted from hero\'s HP. I.e. the hero survives if his HP drops to zero, but dies (and Polycarp looses) if his HP becomes negative due to a fight. If a hero wins a fight with a monster, then the monster disappears, and the cell becomes blank.If a hero steps into a cell containing a potion, then the hero drinks the potion immediately. As a result, potion\'s HP is added to hero\'s HP, the potion disappears, and the cell becomes blank.Obviously, Polycarp wants to win the game. It means that he must choose such rally point and the order in which heroes move, that every hero reaches the rally point and survives. I.e. Polycarp loses if a hero reaches rally point but is killed by a monster at the same time. Polycarp can use any of n cells as a rally point \xe2\x80\x94 initially it can contain a monster, a potion, or be a blank cell with or without a hero in it.Help Polycarp write a program to choose a rally point and the order in which heroes move." 2300

1070B Berkomnadzor "data structures,greedy" "Berkomnadzorï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Mediaï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 is a Berland federal executive body that protects ordinary residents of Berland from the threats of modern internet.Berkomnadzor maintains a list of prohibited IPv4 subnets (blacklist) and a list of allowed IPv4 subnets (whitelist). All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Berland must configure the network equipment to block access to all IPv4 addresses matching the blacklist. Also ISPs must provide access (that is, do not block) to all IPv4 addresses matching the whitelist. If an IPv4 address does not match either of those lists, it\'s up to the ISP to decide whether to block it or not. An IPv4 address matches the blacklist (whitelist) if and only if it matches some subnet from the blacklist (whitelist). An IPv4 address can belong to a whitelist and to a blacklist at the same time, this situation leads to a contradiction (see no solution case in the output description).An IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer written in the form a.b.c.d, where each of the values a,b,c,d is called an octet and is an integer from 0 to 255 written in decimal notation. For example, IPv4 address 192.168.0.1 can be converted to a 32-bit number using the following expression 192\xe2\x8b\x85224+168\xe2\x8b\x85216+0\xe2\x8b\x8528+1\xe2\x8b\x8520. First octet a encodes the most significant (leftmost) 8 bits, the octets b and cï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 the following blocks of 8 bits (in this order), and the octet d encodes the least significant (rightmost) 8 bits.The IPv4 network in Berland is slightly different from the rest of the world. There are no reserved or internal addresses in Berland and use all 232 possible values.An IPv4 subnet is represented either as a.b.c.d or as a.b.c.d/x (where 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa432). A subnet a.b.c.d contains a single address a.b.c.d. A subnet a.b.c.d/x contains all IPv4 addresses with x leftmost (most significant) bits equal to x leftmost bits of the address a.b.c.d. It is required that 32\xe2\x88\x92x rightmost (least significant) bits of subnet a.b.c.d/x are zeroes.Naturally it happens that all addresses matching subnet a.b.c.d/x form a continuous range. The range starts with address a.b.c.d (its rightmost 32\xe2\x88\x92x bits are zeroes). The range ends with address which x leftmost bits equal to x leftmost bits of address a.b.c.d, and its 32\xe2\x88\x92x rightmost bits are all ones. Subnet contains exactly 232\xe2\x88\x92x addresses. Subnet a.b.c.d/32 contains exactly one address and can also be represented by just a.b.c.d.For example subnet 192.168.0.0/24 contains range of 256 addresses. 192.168.0.0 is the first address of the range, and 192.168.0.255 is the last one.Berkomnadzor\'s engineers have devised a plan to improve performance of Berland\'s global network. Instead of maintaining both whitelist and blacklist they want to build only a single optimised blacklist containing minimal number of subnets. The idea is to block all IPv4 addresses matching the optimised blacklist and allow all the rest addresses. Of course, IPv4 addresses from the old blacklist must remain blocked and all IPv4 addresses from the old whitelist must still be allowed. Those IPv4 addresses which matched neither the old blacklist nor the old whitelist may be either blocked or allowed regardless of their accessibility before. Please write a program which takes blacklist and whitelist as input and produces optimised blacklist. The optimised blacklist must contain the minimal possible number of subnets and satisfy all IPv4 addresses accessibility requirements mentioned above. IPv4 subnets in the source lists may intersect arbitrarily. Please output a single number -1 if some IPv4 address matches both source whitelist and blacklist." 2400

For all k\xe2\x89\xa52k\xe2\x89\xa52, kk-multihedgehog is (k\xe2\x88\x921)(k\xe2\x88\x921)-multihedgehog in which the following changes has been made for each vertex vv with degree 1: let uu be its only neighbor; remove vertex vv, create a new hedgehog with center at vertex ww and connect vertices uu and ww with an edge. New hedgehogs can differ from each other and the initial gift. Thereby kk-multihedgehog is a tree. Ivan made kk-multihedgehog but he is not sure that he did not make any mistakes. That is why he asked you to check if his tree is indeed kk-multihedgehog." 1800

Your task is to calculate the answer modulo 998244353.Note that you should add the value aï¿½&ï¿½b to the answer in decimal notation, not in binary.

Otherwise he takes the new empty box and continues the process above. If he has no empty boxes and there is at least one object not in some box then Maksim cannot pack the chosen set of objects.Maksim wants to know the maximum number of objects he can pack by the algorithm above. To reach this target, he will throw out the leftmost object from the set until the remaining set of objects can be packed in boxes he has.

For example, let\'s take a look at S= ""abcdefghi"" and k=2. Pr2= ""ab"", Su2= ""hi"". Reversed Pr2= ""ba"", Su2= ""ih"".

The initial enjoyment of JATC is equal to 0.For example, suppose the deliciousness of 3 parts are [0,1,0]. If JATC eats the second part then his enjoyment will become 1 and the deliciousness of remaining parts will become [1,_,1]. Next, if he eats the first part then his enjoyment will become 2 and the remaining parts will become [_,_,2]. After eating the last part, JATC\'s enjoyment will become 4.However, JATC doesn\'t want to eat all the parts but to save some for later. He gives you q queries, each of them consisting of two integers li and ri. For each query, you have to let him know what is the maximum enjoyment he can get if he eats all the parts with indices in the range [li,ri] in some order.All the queries are independent of each other. Since the answer to the query could be very large, print it modulo 109+7." 1600

However, there is one exception: there are m pairs of heroes that are especially strong against each other, so when any team chooses a hero from such a pair, the other team must choose the other one on its turn. Each hero is in at most one such pair.This is an interactive problem. You are to write a program that will optimally choose the heroes for one team, while the jury\'s program will play for the other team. Note that the jury\'s program may behave inefficiently, in this case you have to take the opportunity and still maximize the total power of your team. Formally, if you ever have chance to reach the total power of q or greater regardless of jury\'s program choices, you must get q or greater to pass a test." 1700

1055G "Jellyfish Nightmare" NA "Bob has put on some weight recently. In order to lose weight a bit, Bob has decided to swim regularly in the pool. However, the day before he went to the pool for the first time he had a weird dream. In this dream Bob was swimming along one of the pool\'s lanes, but also there were some jellyfish swimming around him. It\'s worth mentioning that jellyfish have always been one of Bob\'s deepest childhood fears.Let us assume the following physical model for Bob\'s dream.  The pool\'s lane is an area of the plane between lines x=0x=0 and x=wx=w. Bob is not allowed to swim outside of the lane, but he may touch its bounding lines if he wants.  The jellyfish are very small, but in Bob\'s dream they are extremely swift. Each jellyfish has its area of activity around it. Those areas are circles of various radii, with the jellyfish sitting in their centers. The areas of activity of two jellyfish may overlap and one area of activity may even be fully contained within another one.  Bob has a shape of a convex polygon.  Unfortunately, Bob\'s excess weight has made him very clumsy, and as a result he can\'t rotate his body while swimming. So he swims in a parallel translation pattern. However at any given moment of time he can choose any direction of his movement.  Whenever Bob swims into a jellyfish\'s activity area, it will immediately notice him and sting him very painfully. We assume that Bob has swum into the activity area if at some moment of time the intersection of his body with the jellyfish\'s activity area had a positive area (for example, if they only touch, the jellyfish does not notice Bob).  Once a jellyfish stung Bob, it happily swims away and no longer poses any threat to Bob. Bob wants to swim the lane to its end and get stung the least possible number of times. He will start swimming on the line y=\xe2\x88\x92hy=\xe2\x88\x92h, and finish on the line y=hy=h where h=1010h=1010." 3500

If the path consists of one vertex only, then xor of all integers on edges of this path is equal to 0.Suppose we sorted the resulting n2 values in non-decreasing order.

1055D Refactoring greedy,implementation,strings "Alice has written a program and now tries to improve its readability. One of the ways to improve readability is to give sensible names to the variables, so now Alice wants to rename some variables in her program. In her IDE there is a command called ""massive refactoring"", which can replace names of many variable in just one run. To use it, Alice needs to select two strings s and t and after that for each variable the following algorithm is performed: if the variable\'s name contains s as a substring, then the first (and only first) occurrence of s is replaced with t. If the name doesn\'t contain s, then this variable\'s name stays the same.The list of variables is known and for each variable both the initial name and the name Alice wants this variable change to are known. Moreover, for each variable the lengths of the initial name and the target name are equal (otherwise the alignment of the code could become broken). You need to perform renaming of all variables in exactly one run of the massive refactoring command or determine that it is impossible." 2400

The first task he has to become familiar with is to assemble an electric scheme.The scheme Pasha assembled yesterday consists of several wires. Each wire is a segment that connects two points on a plane with integer coordinates within the segment [1,109][1,109].There are wires of two colors in the scheme:   red wires: these wires are horizontal segments, i.e. if such a wire connects two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2), then y1=y2y1=y2;  blue wires: these wires are vertical segments, i.e. if such a wire connects two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2), then x1=x2x1=x2. Note that if a wire connects a point to itself, it may be blue, and it can be red. Also, in Pasha\'s scheme no two wires of the same color intersect, i.e. there are no two wires of same color that have common points.The imperfection of Pasha\'s scheme was that the wires were not isolated, so in the points where two wires of different colors intersect, Pasha saw sparks. Pasha wrote down all the points where he saw sparks and obtained a set of nn distinct points. After that he disassembled the scheme.Next morning Pasha looked at the set of nn points where he had seen sparks and wondered how many wires had he used. Unfortunately, he does not remember that, so he wonders now what is the smallest number of wires he might have used in the scheme.

The task is to get from one state of the puzzle some other state.To do this, you can use the following operation.  select 2 different cells (x1,y1) and (x2,y2): the cells must be in the same row or in the same column of the table, and the string in the cell (x1,y1) must be non-empty;  in one operation you can move the last character of the string at the cell (x1,y1) to the beginning of the string at the cell (x2,y2). Egor came up with two states of the table for you: the initial state and the final one. It is guaranteed that the number of zeros and ones in the tables are the same. Your goal is with several operations get the final state from the initial state. Of course, Egor does not want the number of operations to be very large.

Your task is to find how many palindrome pairs are there in the array. A palindrome pair is a pair of strings such that the following condition holds: at least one permutation of the concatenation of the two strings is a palindrome. In other words, if you have two strings, let\'s say ""aab"" and ""abcac"", and you concatenate them into ""aababcac"", we have to check if there exists a permutation of this new string such that it is a palindrome (in this case there exists the permutation ""aabccbaa""). Two pairs are considered different if the strings are located on different indices. The pair of strings with indices (i,j) is considered the same as the pair (j,i)." 1600

After jumping from the plane, he will fly in the same direction as the plane, parallel to OxOx axis, covering a unit of distance every second. Naturally, he will also descend; thus his second coordinate will decrease by one unit every second.There are ascending air flows on certain segments, each such segment is characterized by two numbers x1x1 and x2x2 (x1<x2x1<x2) representing its endpoints. No two segments share any common points. When the glider is inside one of such segments, he doesn\'t descend, so his second coordinate stays the same each second. The glider still flies along OxOx axis, covering one unit of distance every second.   If the glider jumps out at 11, he will stop at 1010. Otherwise, if he jumps out at 22, he will stop at 1212. Determine the maximum distance along OxOx axis from the point where the glider\'s flight starts to the point where his flight ends if the glider can choose any integer coordinate to jump from the plane and start his flight.

There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.This time Miroslav laid out n skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from 1 to n in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number i, it leads to turning k closest skewers from each side of the skewer i, that is, skewers number i\xe2\x88\x92k, i\xe2\x88\x92k+1, ..., i\xe2\x88\x921, i+1, ..., i+k\xe2\x88\x921, i+k (if they exist). For example, let n=6 and k=1. When Miroslav turns skewer number 3, then skewers with numbers 2, 3, and 4 will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number 1, then skewers number 1, 3, and 4 will be turned over, while skewer number 2 will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all n skewers with the minimal possible number of actions.

You need to find out whether it is possible to buy suits to form a palindrome, and if it\'s possible, what\'s the minimal cost of doing so.

On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.We want to plan a trip for every evening of m days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:   Either this person does not go on the trip,  Or at least k of his friends also go on the trip. Note that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if a and b are friends and b and c are friends, it does not necessarily imply that a and c are friends.For each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day." 2200

1037D "Valid BFS?" "dfs and similar,graphs,shortest paths,trees" "The BFS algorithm is defined as follows.  Consider an undirected graph with vertices numbered from 1 to n. Initialize q as a new queue containing only vertex 1, mark the vertex 1 as used.  Extract a vertex v from the head of the queue q.  Print the index of vertex v.  Iterate in arbitrary order through all such vertices u that u is a neighbor of v and is not marked yet as used. Mark the vertex u as used and insert it into the tail of the queue q.  If the queue is not empty, continue from step 2.  Otherwise finish. Since the order of choosing neighbors of each vertex can vary, it turns out that there may be multiple sequences which BFS can print.In this problem you need to check whether a given sequence corresponds to some valid BFS traversal of the given tree starting from vertex 1. The tree is an undirected graph, such that there is exactly one simple path between any two vertices." 1700

These definitions imply that some vertices can be both source and sink.The number of sources in the given graph is equal to the number of sinks in it, and each of these numbers doesn\'t exceed 20.The following algorithm is applied to the graph:  if the graph has no sources and sinks then quit;  choose arbitrary source s, arbitrary sink t, add an edge from t to s to the graph and go to step 1 (that operation pops s out of sources and t out of sinks). Note that s and t may be the same vertex, then a self-loop is added. At the end you check if the graph becomes strongly connected (that is, any vertex is reachable from any other vertex).Your task is to check that the graph becomes strongly connected no matter the choice of sources and sinks on the second step of the algorithm." 2700

In this problem no two ever existed orders will have the same price.The lowest-price SELL order and the highest-price BUY order are called the best offers, marked with black frames on the picture below.  The presented order book says that someone wants to sell the product at price 1212 and it\'s the best SELL offer because the other two have higher prices. The best BUY offer has price 1010. There are two possible actions in this orderbook:  Somebody adds a new order of some direction with some price. Somebody accepts the best possible SELL or BUY offer (makes a deal). It\'s impossible to accept not the best SELL or BUY offer (to make a deal at worse price). After someone accepts the offer, it is removed from the orderbook forever.It is allowed to add new BUY order only with prices less than the best SELL offer (if you want to buy stock for higher price, then instead of adding an order you should accept the best SELL offer). Similarly, one couldn\'t add a new SELL order with price less or equal to the best BUY offer.

1025G "Company Acquisitions" "constructive algorithms,math" "There are nn startups. Startups can be active or acquired. If a startup is acquired, then that means it has exactly one active startup that it is following. An active startup can have arbitrarily many acquired startups that are following it. An active startup cannot follow any other startup.The following steps happen until there is exactly one active startup. The following sequence of steps takes exactly 1 day.  Two distinct active startups AA, BB, are chosen uniformly at random.  A fair coin is flipped, and with equal probability, AA acquires BB or BB acquires AA (i.e. if AA acquires BB, then that means BB\'s state changes from active to acquired, and its starts following AA).  When a startup changes from active to acquired, all of its previously acquired startups become active. For example, the following scenario can happen: Let\'s say AA, BB are active startups. CC, DD, EE are acquired startups under AA, and FF, GG are acquired startups under BB: Active startups are shown in red. If AA acquires BB, then the state will be AA, FF, GG are active startups. CC, DD, EE, BB are acquired startups under AA. FF and GG have no acquired startups:  If instead, BB acquires AA, then the state will be BB, CC, DD, EE are active startups. FF, GG, AA are acquired startups under BB. CC, DD, EE have no acquired startups:  You are given the initial state of the startups. For each startup, you are told if it is either acquired or active.

Let\'s call the number of selected pieces the length of the zebra.Before assembling the zebra Grisha can make the following operation 0 or more times. He splits the sequence in some place into two parts, then reverses each of them and sticks them together again. For example, if Grisha has pieces in the order ""bwbbw"" (here \'b\' denotes a black strip, and \'w\' denotes a white strip), then he can split the sequence as bw|bbw (here the vertical bar represents the cut), reverse both parts and obtain ""wbwbb"".Determine the maximum possible length of the zebra that Grisha can produce." 1600

In total there are 26 possible colors of puppies in the nature and they are denoted by letters from \'a\' to \'z\' inclusive.The committee rules strictly prohibit even the smallest diversity between doggos and hence all the puppies should be of the same color. Thus Slava, the committee employee, has been assigned the task to recolor some puppies into other colors in order to eliminate the difference and make all the puppies have one common color.Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons and restricted budget, there\'s only one operation Slava can perform: he can choose a color x such that there are currently at least two puppies of color x and recolor all puppies of the color x into some arbitrary color y. Luckily, this operation can be applied multiple times (including zero).For example, if the number of puppies is 7 and their colors are represented as the string ""abababc"", then in one operation Slava can get the results ""zbzbzbc"", ""bbbbbbc"", ""aaaaaac"", ""acacacc"" and others. However, if the current color sequence is ""abababc"", then he can\'t choose x=\'c\' right now, because currently only one puppy has the color \'c\'.Help Slava and the committee determine whether it is possible to standardize all the puppies, i.e. after Slava\'s operations all the puppies should have the same color." 900

But Mr. Kasoura is challenging the truth of Childan\'s story. So he is going to ask a few questions about Childan\'s so-called ""personal treasure"" necklace.This ""personal treasure"" is a multiset S of m ""01-strings"".A ""01-string"" is a string that contains n characters ""0"" and ""1"". For example, if n=4, strings ""0110"", ""0000"", and ""1110"" are ""01-strings"", but ""00110"" (there are 5 characters, not 4) and ""zero"" (unallowed characters) are not.Note that the multiset S can contain equal elements.Frequently, Mr. Kasoura will provide a ""01-string"" t and ask Childan how many strings s are in the multiset S such that the ""Wu"" value of the pair (s,t) is not greater than k. Mrs. Kasoura and Mr. Kasoura think that if si=ti (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) then the ""Wu"" value of the character pair equals to wi, otherwise 0. The ""Wu"" value of the ""01-string"" pair is the sum of the ""Wu"" values of every character pair. Note that the length of every ""01-string"" is equal to n.For example, if w=[4,5,3,6], ""Wu"" of (""1001"", ""1100"") is 7 because these strings have equal characters only on the first and third positions, so w1+w3=4+3=7.You need to help Childan to answer Mr. Kasoura\'s queries. That is to find the number of strings in the multiset S such that the ""Wu"" value of the pair is not greater than k." 1900

Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.The sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). A subsequence ai1,ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aik where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ik\xe2\x89\xa4n is called increasing if ai1<ai2<ai3<\xe2\x80\xa6<aik. If ai1>ai2>ai3>\xe2\x80\xa6>aik, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.For example, if there is a permutation [6,4,1,7,2,3,5], LIS of this permutation will be [1,2,3,5], so the length of LIS is equal to 4. LDS can be [6,4,1], [6,4,2], or [6,4,3], so the length of LDS is 3.Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.So please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS." 1600

1011A Stages greedy,implementation,sortings "Natasha is going to fly to Mars. She needs to build a rocket, which consists of several stages in some order. Each of the stages is defined by a lowercase Latin letter. This way, the rocket can be described by the stringï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 concatenation of letters, which correspond to the stages.There are n stages available. The rocket must contain exactly k of them. Stages in the rocket should be ordered by their weight. So, after the stage with some letter can go only stage with a letter, which is at least two positions after in the alphabet (skipping one letter in between, or even more). For example, after letter \'c\' can\'t go letters \'a\', \'b\', \'c\' and \'d\', but can go letters \'e\', \'f\', ..., \'z\'.For the rocket to fly as far as possible, its weight should be minimal. The weight of the rocket is equal to the sum of the weights of its stages. The weight of the stage is the number of its letter in the alphabet. For example, the stage \'a \'weighs one ton,\' b \'weighs two tons, and\' z\'ï¿½\xe2\x80\x94 26 tons.Build the rocket with the minimal weight or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all.

It\'s summer now, so this tree does not have any fruit yet.Autumn is coming soon, and leaves and branches will begin to fall off the tree. It is clear, that if a vertex falls off the tree, then its entire subtree will fall off too. In addition, the root will remain on the tree. Formally: the tree will have some connected subset of vertices containing the root.After that, the fruits will grow on the tree (only at those vertices which remain). Exactly xx fruits will grow in the root. The number of fruits in each remaining vertex will be not less than the sum of the numbers of fruits in the remaining sons of this vertex. It is allowed, that some vertices will not have any fruits.Natasha wondered how many tree configurations can be after the described changes. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 998244353998244353.Two configurations of the resulting tree are considered different if one of these two conditions is true: they have different subsets of remaining vertices; they have the same subset of remaining vertices, but there is a vertex in this subset where they have a different amount of fruits." 3400

One bit is fed to each input. One bit is returned at the output.There are four types of logical elements: AND (22 inputs), OR (22 inputs), XOR (22 inputs), NOT (11 input). Logical elements take values from their direct descendants (inputs) and return the result of the function they perform.

However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that 1 ton of fuel can lift off ai tons of rocket from the i-th planet or to land bi tons of rocket onto the i-th planet. For example, if the weight of rocket is 9 tons, weight of fuel is 3 tons and take-off coefficient is 8 (ai=8), then 1.5 tons of fuel will be burnt (since 1.5\xe2\x8b\x858=9+3). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be 1.5 tons. Please note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.Help Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn\'t need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt.

Let\'s say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate 0 km, and Saratov \xe2\x80\x94 at coordinate n km.Driving for a long time may be really difficult.

The root (which has index 11) corresponds to the commander of the army.Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on qq queries, the ii-th query is given as (ui,ki)(ui,ki), where uiui is some officer, and kiki is a positive integer.To process the ii-th query imagine how a command from uiui spreads to the subordinates of uiui.

After bb finishes spreading the command, officer aa chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer aa cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn\'t received this command, officer aa finishes spreading the command.Let\'s look at the following example:  If officer 11 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [1,2,3,5,6,8,7,9,4][1,2,3,5,6,8,7,9,4].If officer 33 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [3,5,6,8,7,9][3,5,6,8,7,9].If officer 77 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [7,9][7,9].If officer 99 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [9][9].To answer the ii-th query (ui,ki)(ui,ki), construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the uiui-th officer spreads it. Return the kiki-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than kiki elements in it.You should process queries independently. A query doesn\'t affect the following queries." 1600

Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.Sonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.For example, if the numbers [1,5,4,1,3] are written, and Sonya gives the number 1 to the first robot and the number 4 to the second one, the first robot will stop in the 1-st position while the second one in the 3-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number 4 to the first robot and the number 5 to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the 3-rd position while the second one is in the 2-nd position.Sonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.Sonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs (p, q), where she will give p to the first robot and q to the second one. Pairs (pi, qi) and (pj, qj) are different if pi\xe2\x89\xa0pj or qi\xe2\x89\xa0qj.Unfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

For example, if analyzing the measures [3,4,1,2] and k=3, we are interested in segments [3,4,1], [4,1,2] and [3,4,1,2] (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days.

All ai must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.The lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment ai the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.Since you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don\'t understand the language it\'s written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program a, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the begining or at the end of a.Find such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from x till moment y, then its lit for y\xe2\x88\x92x units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up." 1500

Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.The paper is divided into nn pieces enumerated from 11 to nn. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the ii-th piece has color cici where ci=0ci=0 defines black color, ci=1ci=1 defines white color and ci=\xe2\x88\x921ci=\xe2\x88\x921 means that the piece hasn\'t been colored yet.The rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color (00 or 11) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, [1\xe2\x86\x920\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x920][1\xe2\x86\x920\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x920], [0\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x920\xe2\x86\x921][0\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x920\xe2\x86\x921], [1][1], [0][0] are valid paths and will be counted.

Let\'s call his favorite parity pp where p=0p=0 stands for ""even"" and p=1p=1 stands for ""odd"".

Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.A random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let\'s call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of 7 because its subribbon a appears 7 times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of 2 because its subribbon abc appears twice.The rules are simple. The game will have n turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn.

Any icicle touched by the wave starts falling at the same speed (that means that in a second the distance from floor to icicle decreases by one but cannot become less that zero). While distance from icicle to floor is more than zero, it is considered passable; as soon as it becomes zero, the icicle blocks the path and prohibits passing.Krakozyabra is initially (i.e. at time instant 0) is located at point  and starts running in the right direction at the speed of one point per second. You can assume that events in a single second happen in the following order: first Krakozyabra changes its position, and only then the sound spreads and icicles fall; in particular, that means that if Krakozyabra is currently at point  and the falling (i.e. already touched by the sound wave) icicle at point i is 1 point from the floor, then Krakozyabra will pass it and find itself at  and only after that the icicle will finally fall and block the path.Krakozyabra is considered entrapped if there are fallen (i.e. with ai\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890) icicles both to the left and to the right of its current position. Help Andrew find the minimum possible time it takes to entrap Krakozyabra by choosing the optimal value of T or report that this mission is impossible." 2900

955D Scissors "brute force,strings" "Jenya has recently acquired quite a useful tool \xe2\x80\x94 k-scissors for cutting strings. They are generally used for cutting out two non-intersecting substrings of length k from an arbitrary string s (its length should be at least 2\xc2\xb7k in order to perform this operation) and concatenating them afterwards (preserving the initial order). For example, with the help of 2-scissors you can cut ab and de out of abcde and concatenate them into abde, but not ab and bc since they\'re intersecting.It\'s a nice idea to test this tool before using it in practice. After looking through the papers, Jenya came up with two strings s and t. His question is whether it is possible to apply his scissors to string s such that the resulting concatenation contains t as a substring?" 2600

Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don\'t care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students.While instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing.

Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers.For each of m company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as ci,\xe2\x80\x891 and ci,\xe2\x80\x892.In order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly. Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new version of software is being deployed to the data center computers each day.Data center software update is a non-trivial long process, that is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated for data center maintenance.

Company should be prepared for such situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment, choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if uj\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89h\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891, then the new maintenance hour would become 0, otherwise it would become uj\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891). Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.Such an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data accessibility guarantees." 1900

Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days a zebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as 0 and good days as 1. Then, for example, sequences of days 0, 010, 01010 are zebras, while sequences 1, 0110, 0101 are not.Oleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of 0 and 1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg\'s life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically.

Once he found a new interesting game about tanks, and he liked it so much that he went through almost all levels in one day. Remained only the last level, which was too tricky. Then Vitya remembered that he is a programmer, and wrote a program that helped him to pass this difficult level. Try do the same.The game is organized as follows. There is a long road, two cells wide and n cells long. Some cells have obstacles. You control a tank that occupies one cell. Initially, the tank is located before the start of the road, in a cell with coordinates (0,\xe2\x80\x891). Your task is to move the tank to the end of the road, to the cell (n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x891) or (n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x892).  Every second the tank moves one cell to the right: the coordinate x is increased by one. When you press the up or down arrow keys, the tank instantly changes the lane, that is, the y coordinate. When you press the spacebar, the tank shoots, and the nearest obstacle along the lane in which the tank rides is instantly destroyed. In order to load a gun, the tank needs t seconds. Initially, the gun is not loaded, that means, the first shot can be made only after t seconds after the tank starts to move.If at some point the tank is in the same cell with an obstacle not yet destroyed, it burns out. If you press the arrow exactly at the moment when the tank moves forward, the tank will first move forward, and then change the lane, so it will not be possible to move diagonally.Your task is to find out whether it is possible to pass the level, and if possible, to find the order of actions the player need to make." 3000

The lock has a screen that displays a string of n lowercase Latin letters. Initially, the screen displays string s. Whitfield and Martin found out that the safe will open when string t will be displayed on the screen.The string on the screen can be changed using the operation \xc2\xabshift x\xc2\xbb. In order to apply this operation, explorers choose an integer x from 0 to n inclusive. After that, the current string p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xb1\xce\xb2 changes to \xce\xb2R\xce\xb1, where the length of \xce\xb2 is x, and the length of \xce\xb1 is n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x. In other words, the suffix of the length x of string p is reversed and moved to the beginning of the string. For example, after the operation \xc2\xabshift 4\xc2\xbb the string \xc2\xababcacb\xc2\xbb will be changed with string \xc2\xabbcacab \xc2\xbb, since \xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89ab, \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89cacb, \xce\xb2R\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89bcac.Explorers are afraid that if they apply too many operations \xc2\xabshift\xc2\xbb, the lock will be locked forever.

928D Autocompletion "*special problem,strings,trees" "Arcady is a copywriter. His today\'s task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.Arcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \xc2\xabcodeforces\xc2\xbb, \xc2\xabcoding\xc2\xbb and \xc2\xabcodeforces\xc2\xbb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \xc2\xabcod\xc2\xbb, but if he proceeds with \xc2\xabcode\xc2\xbb, the editor will propose \xc2\xabcodeforces\xc2\xbb.With a single click Arcady can follow the editor\'s proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?A word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends.

927A "BuberPool Taxi Optimization" "*special problem,interactive" "This is an interactive optimization problem. Instead of having to find the best answer, each solution will get score according to its efficiency. As the problem is interactive, during the testing process, the jury program and your solution will exchange messages via standard input and output streams. After printing a message, remember to flush the output buffer to ensure that the message is fully sent. For example, you can use fflush(stdout) in C++, System.out.flush() in Java, flush(output) in Pascal, and stdout.flush() in Python.Your task is to automate the next generation taxi service, BuberPool. Each Buber car may transport up to four passengers at a time. The cars have to drive to passengers\' locations, pick them up and drive them to their destinations. Additionally, unlike a traditional taxi, each car can process up to four orders simultaneously. For example, when driving a passenger to the destination, a car can pick up an additional passenger, or make a detour to drop off another passenger.We will use the following simplified discrete model for this real-life problem.Consider a city as a rectangular grid of w streets and h avenues with w\xc3\x97h crossroads. The streets are numbered from 1 to w, and the avenues from 1 to h. We will consider non-negative integer moments of time. Actions are performed in ticks: intervals of time between consecutive moments. At any moment, each car is located at some crossroads (x,y), where 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4w and 1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4h. Any number of cars can be at the same crossroads simultaneously. During one tick, each car can either remain on the same crossroads or change exactly one of its coordinates, the street or the avenue, by one.At moment 0, you are given starting locations of k cars: (x1,y1), (x2,y2), \xe2\x80\xa6, (xk,yk). The number of cars is equal to k and does not change during the simulation.Additionally, your solution will be given the clients\' orders. In this problem, each order is made by a single passenger, so a car can process up to four orders at the same time. To further simplify the problem, the moments of orders are all distinct, and the orders are given in chronological order. So, each j-th order is described by five integers: the moment tj, the pick up location (sxj,syj), and the drop-off location (txj,tyj).On tick 0, and also right after receiving each order, you can give instruction sets to the car drivers. Each time you can give instruction sets to any number of cars (more on restrictions later). Instruction sets for different cars are given separately. An instruction set is a sequence of triples (cx1,cy1,a1), (cx2,cy2,a2), \xe2\x80\xa6, (cxm,cym,am), where m is number of instructions in the set. The meaning of these numbers is as follows:  A car should first drive to (cx1,cy1), then to (cx2,cy2), \xe2\x80\xa6, and at last to (cxm,cym). Each location (cxi,cyi) may be any crossroads in the city, not necessarily a pickup or drop-off location. While driving from one location to another, a car always first changes its first coordinate until it is equal to the first coordinate of the destination, and only then the second coordinate. This way, while driving from (p1,q1) to (p2,q2), a car will first move (p1,q1)\xe2\x86\x92(p2,q1), and then (p2,q1)\xe2\x86\x92(p2,q2). In each tick while moving, a car changes exactly one of its coordinates by one.  Values ai encode actions. If ai=0, the car just drives to (cxi,cyi) and doesn\'t do anything special. If ai>0, the car drives to (cxi,cyi) and picks up passenger number ai there (the passenger\'s pickup location should be equal to (cxi,cyi), and the passenger should still be waiting there). If ai<0, the car moves to (cxi,cyi) and drops off passenger number \xe2\x88\x92ai (the passenger\'s drop-off location should be equal to (cxi,cyi), and the passenger should be in this car). Picking up and dropping off passengers are instant. When you give instruction set to a car, its previous instruction set is replaced with the new one. This way, a car only performs at most one instruction set at a time. If there are no instructions, or all of them are completed, the car is waiting at its last location. Instructions are performed in the given order.For each order, first, all the cars perform their current instruction sets until the moment of the order comes, then the order is given to your program, and after that, your program prints new instruction sets for some of the cars. The cars which don\'t get new instruction sets continue performing their old ones.So, the overall testing strategy looks like this:  Your solution reads the city dimensions, the number of cars, and their initial coordinates.  The solution prints instruction sets for some cars, and the cars start performing the instructions.  The solution reads an integer tj, the moment of the next order (if tj=\xe2\x88\x921, your program should print the final instruction sets and exit normally).  The solution reads integers sxj, syj, txj, tyj, the pickup and drop-off locations for j-th order.  The solution prints the next instruction sets for the cars.  Go to step 3. After your program exits in step 3, first, all instructions will be completely performed, and only after that the simulation will end.The score your solution gets for a test is the average score for all orders, rounded to the nearest integer. The score for an order equals \xce\xb1\xe2\x8b\x85(100+w0), where w0 is time the order takes in the ideal case, which is just the time to get from (sxj,syj) to (txj,tyj) (so, w0=|sxj\xe2\x88\x92txj|+|syj\xe2\x88\x92tyj|), and \xce\xb1 is a real value between 0 and 1 which characterizes the passenger\'s satisfaction with the ride. The value \xce\xb1 is calculated by the formula:\xce\xb1=107\xe2\x88\x92min(d21+d22,107)107,where d1 is the waiting time before pickup (the number of ticks between the time of the order and pickup time), and d2 is the difference between actual and ideal travel time (the ideal travel time is w0). If the order was not completed, \xce\xb1=0.The score your solution gets is just the sum of scores for each test." 2900

92101 Labyrinth-1 NA "You have a robot in a two-dimensional labyrinth which consists of N\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89M cells. Some pairs of cells adjacent by side are separated by a wall or a door. The labyrinth itself is separated from the outside with walls around it. Some labyrinth cells are the exits. In order to leave the labyrinth the robot should reach any exit. There are keys in some cells. Any key can open any door but after the door is opened the key stays in the lock. Thus every key can be used only once. There are no labyrinth cells that contain both a key and an exit. Also there can not be both a wall and a door between the pair of adjacent cells.Your need to write a program in abc language (see the language description below) that will lead the robot to one of the exits. Lets numerate the labyrinth rows from 0 to N\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 top to bottom and the columns \xe2\x80\x93 from 0 to M\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 left to right.In abc language the following primary commands are available:  move-DIR \xe2\x80\x93 move to the adjacent cell in the  direction. down increases the number of the row by 1, right increases the number of the column by 1. In case there\xe2\x80\x99s a wall or a closed door in this direction, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happening.  open-DIR \xe2\x80\x93 open the door between the current cell and the adjacent one in DIR direction. In case there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any door in this direction or it\xe2\x80\x99s already been opened or the robot doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a key, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happening. take \xe2\x80\x93 take the key in the current cell. In case there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any key or the robot has already picked it up, nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happening. The robot is able to carry any number of keys. terminate \xe2\x80\x93 terminate the program. This command is not obligatory to use. In case it\xe2\x80\x99s absent the command is added at the end of the program automatically. Also, there are the following control commands in abc language:   for-N OPS end \xe2\x80\x93 repeat the sequence of the OPS commands N times, 0\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100000. Each loop counter check counts as a command fulfilled by the robot.  if-ok  OPS1  else  OPS2  endif \xe2\x80\x93 carries out the sequence of the OPS1 commands, if the previous command of moving, taking the key or opening the door was successful, otherwise the sequence of the OPS2 commands is being carried out. Should there be no previous command run, the sequence OPS1 will be carried out. If-ok check counts as a command fulfilled by the robot.  break \xe2\x80\x93 stops the current for loop.  continue \xe2\x80\x93 finishes the current for loop iterations. Note that the control and the primary commands can be fit into each other arbitrarily.The robot will fulfill your commands sequentially until it exits the labyrinth, or it runs out of the commands, or the terminate command is run, or the quantity of the fulfilled commands exceeds the bound number 5\xc2\xb7106.In abc language each command is a separate word and should be separated from other commands with at least one space symbol.You should write a program that prints the sequence of commands leading the robot out of the labyrinth. Of course, as you are a good programmer, you should optimize these sequence.The number of the non-space symbols in the sequence should not exceed 107. If you succeed in finding the way out of the labyrinth i you\xe2\x80\x99ll be granted the number of points equal to:  where:   Wi \xe2\x80\x93 labyrinth\xe2\x80\x99s weight, some fixed constant.  Gi \xe2\x80\x93 number of robots moves.  Oi \xe2\x80\x93 number of fulfilled commands.

In case your sequence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead the robot to the exit you\xe2\x80\x99ll be granted 0 points. Your programs result will be the sum of all Si.

There are q monsters in upside down. Each one is at a junction (vertex) and is going to some other junction. If monster of type k goes from junction i to junction j, the power it gains is the number of times it sees its special world (sk) consecutively in the tunnels. More formally: If f(i,\xe2\x80\x89j) is the string we get when we concatenate the letters written in the tunnels on the shortest path from i to j, then the power the monster gains is the number of occurrences of sk in f(i,\xe2\x80\x89j).Hopper and Eleven want to get prepared, so for each monster, they want to know the power the monster gains after moving." 3400

Each player in his/her turn should move his/her marble along some edge (a player can move the marble from vertex v to vertex u if there\'s an outgoing edge from v to u). If the player moves his/her marble from vertex v to vertex u, the ""character"" of that round is the character written on the edge from v to u.

The rounds are numbered for both players together, i.ï¿½e. Max goes in odd numbers, Lucas goes in even numbers. The player that can\'t make a move loses the game. The marbles may be at the same vertex at the same time.Since the game could take a while and Lucas and Max have to focus on finding Dart, they don\'t have time to play.

A string consisting of parentheses and question marks (\'?\') is called pretty if and only if there\'s a way to replace each question mark with either \'(\' or \')\' such that the resulting string is a non-empty correct bracket sequence.Will gave his mom a string s consisting of parentheses and question marks (using Morse code through the lights) and his coordinates are the number of pairs of integers (l,\xe2\x80\x89r) such that 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89r\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s| and the string slsl\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891... sr is pretty, where si is i-th character of s.Joyce doesn\'t know anything about bracket sequences, so she asked for your help." 1800

More specifically, a vowel is one of \'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\' or \'u\', and even digit is one of \'0\', \'2\', \'4\', \'6\' or \'8\'.For example, if a card has \'a\' on one side, and \'6\' on the other side, then this statement is true for it. Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with \'b\' and \'4\', and for a card with \'b\' and \'3\' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with \'e\' and \'5\'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards. In particular, if no card has a vowel, the statement is true.To determine this, you can flip over some cards to reveal the other side. You would like to know what is the minimum number of cards you need to flip in the worst case in order to verify that the statement is true." 800

Here are its rules.The game is played on the following field.  Players are making moves by turns. At first move a player can put his chip in any cell of any small field. For following moves, there are some restrictions: if during last move the opposite player put his chip to cell with coordinates (xl,\xe2\x80\x89yl) in some small field, the next move should be done in one of the cells of the small field with coordinates (xl,\xe2\x80\x89yl). For example, if in the first move a player puts his chip to lower left cell of central field, then the second player on his next move should put his chip into some cell of lower left field (pay attention to the first test case). If there are no free cells in the required field, the player can put his chip to any empty cell on any field.You are given current state of the game and coordinates of cell in which the last move was done. You should find all cells in which the current player can put his chip.A hare works as a postman in the forest, he likes to foul bears. Sometimes he changes the game field a bit, so the current state of the game could be unreachable. However, after his changes the cell where the last move was done is not empty.

Of course, Vova started playing it.Now he tries to solve a quest. The task is to come to a settlement named Overcity and spread a rumor in it.Vova knows that there are n characters in Overcity. Some characters are friends to each other, and they share information they got. Also Vova knows that he can bribe each character so he or she starts spreading the rumor; i-th character wants ci gold in exchange for spreading the rumor. When a character hears the rumor, he tells it to all his friends, and they start spreading the rumor to their friends (for free), and so on.The quest is finished when all n characters know the rumor.

Alex, Bob and Carl play in such a way that there are no draws.Today they have played n games, and for each of these games they remember who was the winner. They decided to make up a log of games describing who won each game. But now they doubt if the information in the log is correct, and they want to know if the situation described in the log they made up was possible (that is, no game is won by someone who is spectating if Alex, Bob and Carl play according to the rules).

Receiving guests, Karl learned that the dowry of the i th princess is wi of golden coins. Although the action takes place in the Middle Ages, progressive ideas are widespread in society, according to which no one can force a princess to marry a prince whom she does not like. Therefore, each princess has an opportunity to choose two princes, for each of which she is ready to become a wife. The princes were less fortunate, they will obey the will of their father in the matter of choosing a bride.Knowing the value of the dowry and the preferences of each princess, Charles wants to play weddings in such a way that the total dowry of the brides of all his sons would be as great as possible.

Consider representation of numbers x and y in binary numeric system (probably with leading zeroes) x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89xk... x1x0 and y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89yk... y1y0.

There are dozens of thousands of books in the library.Some long and uninteresting story was removed...The alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter x is denoted by x\'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x893, 2\'\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x893\', 3\'\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x892.A word x1,\xe2\x80\x89x2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89xa is not lexicographically greater than y1,\xe2\x80\x89y2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89yb if one of the two following conditions holds:   a\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89b and x1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89y1,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89xa\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89ya, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word;  there is a position 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89j\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89min(a,\xe2\x80\x89b), such that x1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89y1,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89xj\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89yj\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 and xj\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89yj, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has.

He wants to change some letters to large (let\'s call this process a capitalization) in such a way that the sequence of words is in lexicographical order.

875B "Sorting the Coins" "dsu,implementation,sortings,two pointers" "Recently, Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store, and since then they are collecting coins together. Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. For arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:  He looks through all the coins from left to right;  If he sees that the i-th coin is still in circulation, and (i\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (i\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)-th.  Dima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.Today Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game. First he puts n coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for n times. During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence. The task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help Dima with this task." 1500

The merge algorithm doesn\'t call any other functions. The array in this problem is 0-indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call mergesort(a,\xe2\x80\x890,\xe2\x80\x89n).The number of calls of function mergesort is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array. For example, if a\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89{1,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x893,\xe2\x80\x894}, then there will be 1 call of mergesort \xe2\x80\x94 mergesort(0,\xe2\x80\x894), which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If a\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89{2,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x893}, then the number of calls is 3: first of all, you call mergesort(0,\xe2\x80\x893), which then sets mid\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891 and calls mergesort(0,\xe2\x80\x891) and mergesort(1,\xe2\x80\x893), which do not perform any recursive calls because segments (0,\xe2\x80\x891) and (1,\xe2\x80\x893) are sorted.Ivan has implemented the program that counts the number of mergesort calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array a such that a is a permutation of size n (that is, the number of elements in a is n, and every integer number from [1,\xe2\x80\x89n] can be found in this array), and the number of mergesort calls when sorting the array is exactly k.Help Ivan to find an array he wants!" 1800

Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant.

One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.For example:  the following words have typos: ""hellno"", ""hackcerrs"" and ""backtothefutttture"";  the following words don\'t have typos: ""helllllooooo"", ""tobeornottobe"" and ""oooooo"". When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: \'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\' and \'u\'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem." 1500

Each snake lands parallel to the entrance, covering a segment at a distance k from x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89l to x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89r. Formally, each snake can be imagined as being a line segment between points (l,\xe2\x80\x89k) and (r,\xe2\x80\x89k). Note that k can be both positive and negative, but not 0.Let, at some x-coordinate x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89i, there be snakes at point (i,\xe2\x80\x89y1) and point (i,\xe2\x80\x89y2), such that y1\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890 and y2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890. Then, if for any point (i,\xe2\x80\x89y3) containing a snake such that y3\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890, y1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89y3 holds and for any point (i,\xe2\x80\x89y4) containing a snake such that y4\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890, |y2|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|y4| holds, then the danger value at coordinate x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89i is y1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89|y2|. If no such y1 and y2 exist, danger value is 0. Harry wants to calculate the danger value of various segments of the Hogwarts entrance. Danger value for a segment [l,\xe2\x80\x89r) of the entrance can be calculated by taking the sum of danger values for each integer x-coordinate present in the segment.Formally, you have to implement two types of queries:  1 l r k: a snake is added parallel to entrance from x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89l to x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89r at y-coordinate y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89k (l inclusive, r exclusive).  2 l r: you have to calculate the danger value of segment l to r (l inclusive, r exclusive)." 800

The house has n apartments that are numbered from 1 to n and are arranged in a row. Two apartments are adjacent if their indices differ by 1. Some of the apartments can already be inhabited, others are available for sale.Maxim often visits his neighbors, so apartment is good for him if it is available for sale and there is at least one already inhabited apartment adjacent to it.

854A Fraction "brute force,constructive algorithms,math" "Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction  is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button (\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89) instead of division button (\xc3\xb7) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That\'s why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction  such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem." 800

853E "Lada Malina" "data structures,geometry" "After long-term research and lots of experiments leading Megapolian automobile manufacturer \xc2\xabAutoVoz\xc2\xbb released a brand new car model named \xc2\xabLada Malina\xc2\xbb. One of the most impressive features of \xc2\xabLada Malina\xc2\xbb is its highly efficient environment-friendly engines.Consider car as a point in Oxy plane. Car is equipped with k engines numbered from 1 to k. Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are (vxi,\xe2\x80\x89vyi) measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level wi, that is a real number between \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 and \xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 (inclusive) that result in a term of (wi\xc2\xb7vxi,\xe2\x80\x89wi\xc2\xb7vyi) in the final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to (w1\xc2\xb7vx1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89w2\xc2\xb7vx2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89...\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89wk\xc2\xb7vxk,\xe2\x80\x89ï¿½ï¿½w1\xc2\xb7vy1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89w2\xc2\xb7vy2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89...\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89wk\xc2\xb7vyk) Formally, if car moves with constant values of wi during the whole day then its x-coordinate will change by the first component of an expression above, and its y-coordinate will change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if all wi are equal to zero, the car won\'t move, and if all wi are equal to zero except w1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891, then car will move with the velocity of the first engine.There are n factories in Megapolia, i-th of them is located in (fxi,\xe2\x80\x89fyi). On the i-th factory there are ai cars \xc2\xabLada Malina\xc2\xbb that are ready for operation.As an attempt to increase sales of a new car, \xc2\xabAutoVoz\xc2\xbb is going to hold an international exposition of cars. There are q options of exposition location and time, in the i-th of them exposition will happen in a point with coordinates (pxi,\xe2\x80\x89pyi) in ti days. Of course, at the \xc2\xabAutoVoz\xc2\xbb is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location. However, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars from some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an exposition. Your task is to determine for each of the options of exposition location and time how many cars will be able to get there by the beginning of an exposition." 3400

The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour.

A quarter labeled with letter \'A\' produces q units of noise. A quarter labeled with letter \'B\' produces 2\xc2\xb7q units of noise. And so on, up to a quarter labeled with letter \'Z\', which produces 26\xc2\xb7q units of noise. There can be any number of quarters labeled with each letter in the city.When propagating from the source of the noise, the noise level is halved when moving from one quarter to a quarter that shares a side with it (when an odd number is to be halved, it\'s rounded down). The noise spreads along the chain. For example, if some quarter is located at a distance 2 from the noise source, then the value of noise which will reach the quarter is divided by 4. So the noise level that comes from the source to the quarter is determined solely by the length of the shortest path between them. Heavily built-up quarters are obstacles, the noise does not penetrate into them.  The values in the cells of the table on the right show the total noise level in the respective quarters for q\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89100, the first term in each sum is the noise from the quarter \'A\', the second \xe2\x80\x94 the noise from the quarter \'B\'.

Your task is to construct a regular bracket sequence consisting of round brackets with length 2\xc2\xb7n with total sum of nesting of all opening brackets equals to exactly k. The nesting of a single opening bracket equals to the number of pairs of brackets in which current opening bracket is embedded.For example, in the sequence ""()(())"" the nesting of first opening bracket equals to 0, the nesting of the second opening bracket equals to 0 and the nesting of the third opening bracket equal to 1. So the total sum of nestings equals to 1." 1800

847A "Union of Doubly Linked Lists" implementation "Doubly linked list is one of the fundamental data structures. A doubly linked list is a sequence of elements, each containing information about the previous and the next elements of the list. In this problem all lists have linear structure. I.e. each element except the first has exactly one previous element, each element except the last has exactly one next element. The list is not closed in a cycle.In this problem you are given n memory cells forming one or more doubly linked lists. Each cell contains information about element from some list. Memory cells are numbered from 1 to n.For each cell i you are given two values:   li \xe2\x80\x94 cell containing previous element for the element in the cell i;  ri \xe2\x80\x94 cell containing next element for the element in the cell i. If cell i contains information about the element which has no previous element then li\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890. Similarly, if cell i contains information about the element which has no next element then ri\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.  Three lists are shown on the picture.

835A "Key races" math "Two boys decided to compete in text typing on the site ""Key races"". During the competition, they have to type a text consisting of s characters. The first participant types one character in v1 milliseconds and has ping t1 milliseconds. The second participant types one character in v2 milliseconds and has ping t2 milliseconds.If connection ping (delay) is t milliseconds, the competition passes for a participant as follows:   Exactly after t milliseconds after the start of the competition the participant receives the text to be entered.  Right after that he starts to type it.  Exactly t milliseconds after he ends typing all the text, the site receives information about it. The winner is the participant whose information on the success comes earlier. If the information comes from both participants at the same time, it is considered that there is a draw.Given the length of the text and the information about participants, determine the result of the game." 800

834B "The Festive Evening" "data structures,implementation" "It\'s the end of Julyï¿½\xe2\x80\x93 the time when a festive evening is held at Jelly Castle! Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it\'s a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.There are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest\'s arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.For an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are k such guards in the castle, so if there are more than k opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can\'t leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.Slastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than k doors were opened." 1100

Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):  After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly n seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this." 900

Of course, the clouds make shadows, and the seedlings can\'t grow when there is at least one cloud veiling the sun.Slastyona wants to grow up her muffins as fast as possible. She has exactly C candies, which is the main currency in Sweetland. One can dispel any cloud by paying ci candies. However, in order to comply with Sweetland\'s Department of Meteorology regulations, one can\'t dispel more than two clouds.Slastyona hasn\'t decided yet which of the m seedlings will be planted at the princess\' garden, so she needs your help.

This time she watches a strange red-black spider sitting at the center of a huge cobweb.The cobweb is a set of n nodes connected by threads, each of the treads is either red of black. Using these threads, the spider can move between nodes. No thread connects a node to itself, and between any two nodes there is a unique sequence of threads connecting them.Slastyona decided to study some special qualities of the cobweb. She noticed that each of the threads has a value of clamminess x.However, Slastyona is mostly interested in jelliness of the cobweb. Consider those of the shortest paths between each pair of nodes on which the numbers of red and black threads differ at most twice. For each such path compute the product of the clamminess of threads on the path.The jelliness of the cobweb is the product of all obtained values among all paths. Those paths that differ by direction only are counted only once.Of course, this number can be huge, so Slastyona asks you to compute the jelliness of the given cobweb and print the answer modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897." 2800

It is, truth to be said, always eager to have something for dinner.Its favorite meal is natural numbers (typically served with honey sauce), or, to be more precise, the zeros in their corresponding decimal representations. As for other digits, Krakozyabra dislikes them; moreover, they often cause it indigestion! So, as a necessary precaution, Krakozyabra prefers to sort the digits of a number in non-descending order before proceeding to feast. Then, the leading zeros of the resulting number are eaten and the remaining part is discarded as an inedible tail.For example, if Krakozyabra is to have the number 57040 for dinner, its inedible tail would be the number 457.Slastyona is not really fond of the idea of Krakozyabra living in her castle. Hovewer, her natural hospitality prevents her from leaving her guest without food. Slastyona has a range of natural numbers from L to R, which she is going to feed the guest with. Help her determine how many distinct inedible tails are going to be discarded by Krakozyabra by the end of the dinner." 2700

She bought required ingredients and a wonder-oven which can bake several types of cakes, and opened the bakery.Soon the expenses started to overcome the income, so Slastyona decided to study the sweets market. She learned it\'s profitable to pack cakes in boxes, and that the more distinct cake types a box contains (let\'s denote this number as the value of the box), the higher price it has.She needs to change the production technology! The problem is that the oven chooses the cake types on its own and Slastyona can\'t affect it. However, she knows the types and order of n cakes the oven is going to bake today. Slastyona has to pack exactly k boxes with cakes today, and she has to put in each box several (at least one) cakes the oven produced one right after another (in other words, she has to put in a box a continuous segment of cakes).Slastyona wants to maximize the total value of all boxes with cakes.

Its rules are very simple: in each round, a natural number k is chosen. Then, the one who says (or barks) it faster than the other wins the round. After that, the winner\'s score is multiplied by k2, and the loser\'s score is multiplied by k. In the beginning of the game, both Slastyona and Pushok have scores equal to one.Unfortunately, Slastyona had lost her notepad where the history of all n games was recorded. She managed to recall the final results for each games, though, but all of her memories of them are vague.

Moreover, the set is split into n groups of 4 equal strings each. Vasya also has one special string a of the same length, consisting of letters ""a"" only.Vasya wants to obtain from string a some fixed string b, in order to do this, he can use the strings from his set in any order. When he uses some string x, each of the letters in string a replaces with the next letter in alphabet as many times as the alphabet position, counting from zero, of the corresponding letter in string x. Within this process the next letter in alphabet after ""e"" is ""a"".For example, if some letter in a equals ""b"", and the letter on the same position in x equals ""c"", then the letter in a becomes equal ""d"", because ""c"" is the second alphabet letter, counting from zero. If some letter in a equals ""e"", and on the same position in x is ""d"", then the letter in a becomes ""c"". For example, if the string a equals ""abcde"", and string x equals ""baddc"", then a becomes ""bbabb"".A used string disappears, but Vasya can use equal strings several times.Vasya wants to know for q given strings b, how many ways there are to obtain from the string a string b using the given set of 4n strings? Two ways are different if the number of strings used from some group of 4 strings is different. Help Vasya compute the answers for these questions modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897." 2600

822F Madness "constructive algorithms,dfs and similar,trees" "The second semester starts at the University of Pavlopolis. After vacation in Vi\xc4\x8dkopolis Noora needs to return to Pavlopolis and continue her study.Sometimes (or quite often) there are teachers who do not like you. Incidentally Noora also has one such teacher. His name is Yury Dmitrievich and he teaches graph theory. Yury Dmitrievich doesn\'t like Noora, so he always gives the girl the most difficult tasks. So it happened this time.The teacher gives Noora a tree with n vertices. Vertices are numbered with integers from 1 to n. The length of all the edges of this tree is 1. Noora chooses a set of simple paths that pairwise don\'t intersect in edges. However each vertex should belong to at least one of the selected path.For each of the selected paths, the following is done:  We choose exactly one edge (u,\xe2\x80\x89v) that belongs to the path.  On the selected edge (u,\xe2\x80\x89v) there is a point at some selected distance x from the vertex u and at distance 1\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x from vertex v. But the distance x chosen by Noora arbitrarily, i. e. it can be different for different edges.  One of the vertices u or v is selected. The point will start moving to the selected vertex. Let us explain how the point moves by example. Suppose that the path consists of two edges (v1,\xe2\x80\x89v2) and (v2,\xe2\x80\x89v3), the point initially stands on the edge (v1,\xe2\x80\x89v2) and begins its movement to the vertex v1. Then the point will reach v1, then ""turn around"", because the end of the path was reached, further it will move in another direction to vertex v2, then to vertex v3, then ""turn around"" again, then move to v2 and so on. The speed of the points is 1 edge per second. For example, for 0.5 second the point moves to the length of the half of an edge.A stopwatch is placed at each vertex of the tree. The time that the stopwatches indicate at start time is 0 seconds. Then at the starting moment of time, all points simultaneously start moving from the selected positions to selected directions along the selected paths, and stopwatches are simultaneously started. When one of the points reaches the vertex v, the stopwatch at the vertex v is automatically reset, i.e. it starts counting the time from zero.Denote by resv the maximal time that the stopwatch at the vertex v will show if the point movement continues infinitely. Noora is asked to select paths and points on them so that res1 is as minimal as possible. If there are several solutions to do this, it is necessary to minimize res2, then res3, res4,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89resn.Help Noora complete the teacher\'s task.For the better understanding of the statement, see the explanation for the example." 2500

822E Liar "binary search,dp,hashing,string suffix structures" "The first semester ended. You know, after the end of the first semester the holidays begin. On holidays Noora decided to return to Vi\xc4\x8dkopolis. As a modest souvenir for Leha, she brought a sausage of length m from Pavlopolis. Everyone knows that any sausage can be represented as a string of lowercase English letters, the length of which is equal to the length of the sausage.Leha was very pleased with the gift and immediately ate the sausage. But then he realized that it was a quite tactless act, because the sausage was a souvenir! So the hacker immediately went to the butcher shop. Unfortunately, there was only another sausage of length n in the shop. However Leha was not upset and bought this sausage. After coming home, he decided to cut the purchased sausage into several pieces and number the pieces starting from 1 from left to right. Then he wants to select several pieces and glue them together so that the obtained sausage is equal to the sausage that Noora gave. But the hacker can glue two pieces together only when the number of the left piece is less than the number of the right piece. Besides he knows that if he glues more than x pieces, Noora will notice that he has falsified souvenir sausage and will be very upset. Of course Leha doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to upset the girl. The hacker asks you to find out whether he is able to cut the sausage he bought, and then glue some of the pieces so that Noora doesn\'t notice anything.Formally, you are given two strings s and t. The length of the string s is n, the length of the string t is m. It is required to select several pairwise non-intersecting substrings from s, so that their concatenation in the same order as these substrings appear in s, is equal to the string t. Denote by f(s,\xe2\x80\x89t) the minimal number of substrings to be chosen so that their concatenation is equal to the string t. If it is impossible to choose such substrings, then f(s,\xe2\x80\x89t)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x9e.

822D "My pretty girl Noora" "brute force,dp,greedy,math,number theory" "In Pavlopolis University where Noora studies it was decided to hold beauty contest ""Miss Pavlopolis University"". Let\'s describe the process of choosing the most beautiful girl in the university in more detail.The contest is held in several stages. Suppose that exactly n girls participate in the competition initially. All the participants are divided into equal groups, x participants in each group. Furthermore the number x is chosen arbitrarily, i. e. on every stage number x can be different. Within each group the jury of the contest compares beauty of the girls in the format ""each with each"". In this way, if group consists of x girls, then  comparisons occur. Then, from each group, the most beautiful participant is selected. Selected girls enter the next stage of the competition. Thus if n girls were divided into groups, x participants in each group, then exactly  participants will enter the next stage. The contest continues until there is exactly one girl left who will be ""Miss Pavlopolis University""But for the jury this contest is a very tedious task. They would like to divide the girls into groups in each stage so that the total number of pairwise comparisons of the girls is as few as possible. Let f(n) be the minimal total number of comparisons that should be made to select the most beautiful participant, if we admit n girls to the first stage.The organizers of the competition are insane. They give Noora three integers t, l and r and ask the poor girl to calculate the value of the following expression: t0\xc2\xb7f(l)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89t1\xc2\xb7f(l\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89...\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89tr\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89l\xc2\xb7f(r). However, since the value of this expression can be quite large the organizers ask her to calculate it modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897. If Noora can calculate the value of this expression the organizers promise her to help during the beauty contest. But the poor girl is not strong in mathematics, so she turned for help to Leha and he turned to you." 1800

819A "Mister B and Boring Game" games,greedy "Sometimes Mister B has free evenings when he doesn\'t know what to do. Fortunately, Mister B found a new game, where the player can play against aliens.All characters in this game are lowercase English letters. There are two players: Mister B and his competitor.Initially the players have a string s consisting of the first a English letters in alphabetical order (for example, if a\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895, then s equals to ""abcde"").The players take turns appending letters to string s. Mister B moves first.Mister B must append exactly b letters on each his move. He can arbitrary choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly a letters on each move.Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm. The computer on each turn considers the suffix of string s of length a and generates a string t of length a such that all letters in the string t are distinct and don\'t appear in the considered suffix. From multiple variants of t lexicographically minimal is chosen (if a\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894 and the suffix is ""bfdd"", the computer chooses string t equal to ""aceg""). After that the chosen string t is appended to the end of s.Mister B soon found the game boring and came up with the following question: what can be the minimum possible number of different letters in string s on the segment between positions l and r, inclusive. Letters of string s are numerated starting from 1." 2200

This time Alice wants to form four melodies for her tracks.Alice has a sheet with n notes written on it. She wants to take four such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that all of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.Subsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differ by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.You should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such four non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that all of them form a melody." 2600

818F "Level Generation" "binary search,math,ternary search" "Ivan is developing his own computer game. Now he tries to create some levels for his game. But firstly for each level he needs to draw a graph representing the structure of the level.Ivan decided that there should be exactly ni vertices in the graph representing level i, and the edges have to be bidirectional. When constructing the graph, Ivan is interested in special edges called bridges. An edge between two vertices u and v is called a bridge if this edge belongs to every path between u and v (and these vertices will belong to different connected components if we delete this edge). For each level Ivan wants to construct a graph where at least half of the edges are bridges. He also wants to maximize the number of edges in each constructed graph.So the task Ivan gave you is: given q numbers n1,\xe2\x80\x89n2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89nq, for each i tell the maximum number of edges in a graph with ni vertices, if at least half of the edges are bridges.

Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.To get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi\'s sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.Hitagi\'s sequence a has a length of n. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence b, whose length k equals the number of lost elements in a (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in a with an element from b so that each element in b should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in a and b more than once in total.If the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki\'s sequence is just another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is possible to replace each zero in a with an integer from b so that each integer from b is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence is not increasing." 900

He requests the toys one after another at distinct moments of time. A child starts playing if and only if he is granted all the toys in his lovely set. If a child starts playing, then sooner or later he gives the toys back. No child keeps the toys forever. Children request toys at distinct moments of time. No two children request a toy at the same time. If a child is granted a toy, he never gives it back until he finishes playing with his lovely set. If a child is not granted a toy, he waits until he is granted this toy. He can\'t request another toy while waiting. If two children are waiting for the same toy, then the child who requested it first will take the toy first.Children don\'t like to play with each other. That\'s why they never share toys. When a child requests a toy, then granting the toy to this child depends on whether the toy is free or not. If the toy is free, Sagheer will give it to the child. Otherwise, the child has to wait for it and can\'t request another toy.Children are smart and can detect if they have to wait forever before they get the toys they want. In such case they start crying. In other words, a crying set is a set of children in which each child is waiting for a toy that is kept by another child in the set.Now, we have reached a scenario where all the children made all the requests for their lovely sets, except for one child x that still has one last request for his lovely set. Some children are playing while others are waiting for a toy, but no child is crying, and no one has yet finished playing.

Upon arrival, they left the car in a huge parking lot near the restaurant and hurried inside the building.In the restaurant a polite waiter immediately brought the menu to Leha and Noora, consisting of n dishes. It is interesting that all dishes in the menu are numbered with integers from 1 to n. After a little thought, the girl ordered exactly k different dishes from available in the menu. To pass the waiting time while the chefs prepare ordered dishes, the girl invited the hacker to play a game that will help them get to know each other better.The game itself is very simple: Noora wants Leha to guess any two dishes among all ordered. At the same time, she is ready to answer only one type of questions. Leha can say two numbers x and y (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x,\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n). After that Noora chooses some dish a for the number x such that, at first, a is among the dishes Noora ordered (x can be equal to a), and, secondly, the value  is the minimum possible. By the same rules the girl chooses dish b for y. After that Noora says \xc2\xabTAK\xc2\xbb to Leha, if , and \xc2\xabNIE\xc2\xbb otherwise. However, the restaurant is preparing quickly, so Leha has enough time to ask no more than 60 questions. After that he should name numbers of any two dishes Noora ordered.Help Leha to solve this problem!" 2200

That happened 10100 years ago and then all of the gangs escaped to a remote area, far from towns.During the years, they were copying some gold bullions according to an organized plan in order to not get arrested. They constructed a tournament directed graph (a graph where there is exactly one directed edge between every pair of vertices) of gangs (the graph is given in the input). In this graph an edge from u to v means that in the i-th hour the person  of the gang u can send a fake gold bullion to person  of gang v. He sends it if he has some bullion (real or fake), while the receiver doesn\'t have any. Thus, at any moment each of the gangsters has zero or one gold bullion. Some of them have real bullions, and some of them have fake ones.In the beginning of this year, the police has finally found the gangs, but they couldn\'t catch them, as usual. The police decided to open a jewelry store so that the gangsters would sell the bullions. Thus, every gangster that has a bullion (fake or real) will try to sell it. If he has a real gold bullion, he sells it without problems, but if he has a fake one, there is a choice of two events that can happen:   The person sells the gold bullion successfully.  The person is arrested by police. The power of a gang is the number of people in it that successfully sold their bullion. After all selling is done, the police arrests b gangs out of top gangs. Sort the gangs by powers, we call the first a gang top gangs(you can sort the equal powers in each order).

Thieves and terrorists are always ready to ruin the country\'s peace. To fight back, Zane and Inzane have enacted a very effective law: from each city it must be possible to reach a police station by traveling at most d kilometers along the roads.  There are n cities in the country, numbered from 1 to n, connected only by exactly n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 roads. All roads are 1 kilometer long. It is initially possible to travel from a city to any other city using these roads. The country also has k police stations located in some cities. In particular, the city\'s structure satisfies the requirement enforced by the previously mentioned law. Also note that there can be multiple police stations in one city.However, Zane feels like having as many as n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 roads is unnecessary. The country is having financial issues, so it wants to minimize the road maintenance cost by shutting down as many roads as possible.Help Zane find the maximum number of roads that can be shut down without breaking the law.

To search for Zane, he would need a lot of money, of which he sadly has none. To deal with the problem, he has decided to hack the banks.  There are n banks, numbered from 1 to n. There are also n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 wires connecting the banks. All banks are initially online. Each bank also has its initial strength: bank i has initial strength ai.Let us define some keywords before we proceed. Bank i and bank j are neighboring if and only if there exists a wire directly connecting them. Bank i and bank j are semi-neighboring if and only if there exists an online bank k such that bank i and bank k are neighboring and bank k and bank j are neighboring.When a bank is hacked, it becomes offline (and no longer online), and other banks that are neighboring or semi-neighboring to it have their strengths increased by 1.To start his plan, Inzane will choose a bank to hack first. Indeed, the strength of such bank must not exceed the strength of his computer. After this, he will repeatedly choose some bank to hack next until all the banks are hacked, but he can continue to hack bank x if and only if all these conditions are met:  Bank x is online. That is, bank x is not hacked yet.  Bank x is neighboring to some offline bank.  The strength of bank x is less than or equal to the strength of Inzane\'s computer. Determine the minimum strength of the computer Inzane needs to hack all the banks." 1900

If the bone happens to be at the position where there is a hole at any time, it will fall into the hole onto the ground and will not be affected by future swapping operations.Do not forget that Zane is a wizard. When he swaps the cups, he does not move them ordinarily. Instead, he teleports the cups (along with the bone, if it is inside) to the intended positions. Therefore, for example, when he swaps the cup at x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894 and the one at x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x896, they will not be at the position x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895 at any moment during the operation.

794G "Replace All" combinatorics,dp,math "Igor the analyst is at work. He learned about a feature in his text editor called ""Replace All"". Igor is too bored at work and thus he came up with the following problem:Given two strings x and y which consist of the English letters \'A\' and \'B\' only, a pair of strings (s,\xe2\x80\x89t) is called good if: s and t consist of the characters \'0\' and \'1\' only. 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s|,\xe2\x80\x89|t|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n, where |z| denotes the length of string z, and n is a fixed positive integer. If we replace all occurrences of \'A\' in x and y with the string s, and replace all occurrences of \'B\' in x and y with the string t, then the two obtained from x and y strings are equal. For example, if x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89AAB, y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89BB and n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894, then (01, 0101) is one of good pairs of strings, because both obtained after replacing strings are ""01010101"".The flexibility of a pair of strings x and y is the number of pairs of good strings (s,\xe2\x80\x89t). The pairs are ordered, for example the pairs (0, 1) and (1, 0) are different.You\'re given two strings c and d. They consist of characters \'A\', \'B\' and \'?\' only. Find the sum of flexibilities of all possible pairs of strings (c\',\xe2\x80\x89d\') such that c\' and d\' can be obtained from c and d respectively by replacing the question marks with either \'A\' or \'B\', modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897." 3400

All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So n is a number such that n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 is a power of 2.In the picture you can see a complete binary tree with n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8915.  Vertices are numbered from 1 to n in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.You have to write a program that for given n answers q queries to the tree.Each query consists of an integer number ui (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ui\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) and a string si, where ui is the number of vertex, and si represents the path starting from this vertex. String si doesn\'t contain any characters other than \'L\', \'R\' and \'U\', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from si have to be processed from left to right, considering that ui is the vertex where the path starts. If it\'s impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by si ends.For example, if ui\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894 and si\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xabUURL\xc2\xbb, then the answer is 10." 1900

792C "Divide by Three" "dp,greedy,math,number theory" "A positive integer number n is written on a blackboard. It consists of not more than 105 digits. You have to transform it into a beautiful number by erasing some of the digits, and you want to erase as few digits as possible.The number is called beautiful if it consists of at least one digit, doesn\'t have leading zeroes and is a multiple of 3. For example, 0, 99, 10110 are beautiful numbers, and 00, 03, 122 are not.Write a program which for the given n will find a beautiful number such that n can be transformed into this number by erasing as few digits as possible. You can erase an arbitraty set of digits. For example, they don\'t have to go one after another in the number n.If it\'s impossible to obtain a beautiful number, print -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them." 2000

792B "Counting-out Rhyme" implementation "n children are standing in a circle and playing the counting-out game. Children are numbered clockwise from 1 to n. In the beginning, the first child is considered the leader. The game is played in k steps. In the i-th step the leader counts out ai people in clockwise order, starting from the next person. The last one to be pointed at by the leader is eliminated, and the next player after him becomes the new leader.For example, if there are children with numbers [8,\xe2\x80\x8910,\xe2\x80\x8913,\xe2\x80\x8914,\xe2\x80\x8916] currently in the circle, the leader is child 13 and ai\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8912, then counting-out rhyme ends on child 16, who is eliminated. Child 8 becomes the leader.You have to write a program which prints the number of the child to be eliminated on every step." 1300

The teams should consist of 5 participants.The team of Uzhlyandia will consist of soldiers, because there are no gamers.Masha is a new minister of defense and gaming. The prime duty of the minister is to calculate the efficiency of the Uzhlandian army. The army consists of n soldiers standing in a row, enumerated from 1 to n.

However, since the coordinates of the lines don\'t exceed 108 by absolute value, Roma can\'t choose a point with coordinates exceeding 108 by absolute value. Uncle Anton is in a hurry to the UOI (Uzhlandian Olympiad in Informatics), so he can only answer no more than 3\xc2\xb7105 questions.The problem is that Roma doesn\'t know how to find out the coordinates of the lines.

A bracket sequence s of length n is an RSBS if the following conditions are met:  It is not empty (that is n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x890).  The length of the sequence is even.  First  charactes of the sequence are equal to ""("".  Last  charactes of the sequence are equal to "")"". For example, the sequence ""((()))"" is an RSBS but the sequences ""((())"" and ""(()())"" are not RSBS.Elena Ivanovna, Anton\'s teacher, gave him the following task as a homework. Given a bracket sequence s. Find the number of its distinct subsequences such that they are RSBS. Note that a subsequence of s is a string that can be obtained from s by deleting some of its elements. Two subsequences are considered distinct if distinct sets of positions are deleted.Because the answer can be very big and Anton\'s teacher doesn\'t like big numbers, she asks Anton to find the answer modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.Anton thought of this task for a very long time, but he still doesn\'t know how to solve it.

Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn\'t fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn\'t fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn\'t fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. Anton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn.

777B "Game of Credit Cards" "data structures,dp,greedy,sortings" "After the fourth season Sherlock and Moriary have realized the whole foolishness of the battle between them and decided to continue their competitions in peaceful game of Credit Cards.Rules of this game are simple: each player bring his favourite n-digit credit card. Then both players name the digits written on their cards one by one. If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893, Sherlock\'s card is 123 and Moriarty\'s card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.Of course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name 1, 2, 3 and get no flicks at all, or he can name 2, 3 and 1 to give Sherlock two flicks.Your goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty. Note, that these two goals are different and the optimal result may be obtained by using different strategies." 1300

777A "Shell Game" "constructive algorithms,implementation,math" "Bomboslav likes to look out of the window in his room and watch lads outside playing famous shell game. The game is played by two persons: operator and player. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.Bomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).Let\'s number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2. Bomboslav has missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows that exactly n movements were made by the operator and the ball was under shell x at the end. Now he wonders, what was the initial position of the ball?" 1000

Consider that there are 6 educational days in week and maximum number of classes per educational day is 7 (classes numerated from 1 to 7 for each educational day).It is known that in university n students study, m professors work and there are a classrooms for conducting classes. Also you have two-dimensional array with n\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89m size which contains the following information. The number which stays in i-th row and j-th column equals to the number of classes which professor j must conduct with the group i in a single week. The schedule which you output must satisfy to array described above.There are several other conditions for schedule. Single professor can not conduct more than one class. Similarly, single student group can not be on more than one class at the same time.Let define a fatigue function for professors and student groups. Call this function f.To single professor fatigue calculated in the following way. Let look on classes which this professor must conduct in each of the 6-th educational days. Let x be the number of class which professor will firstly conduct in day i and let y \xe2\x80\x94 the last class for this professor. Then the value (2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)\xc2\xb7(2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891) must be added to professor\'s fatigue. If professor has no classes in day i, nothing is added to professor\'s fatigue. For single student group fatigue is calculated similarly. Lets look at classes of this group in each of the 6 educational days. Let x be the number of first class for this group on day i and let y \xe2\x80\x94 the last class for this group. Then the value (2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)\xc2\xb7(2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891) must be added to this group\'s fatigue.

For each test you will get a certain number of points. It equals to result of division of the value of function f from the jury solution by the value of function f for schedule which your program output (i. e. the smaller value of {fatigue} function your program find the more points you will get), multiplied by 100. In the other words if the value of f for jury solution equals to p and for your solution \xe2\x80\x94 to q, you will get 100\xc2\xb7p\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x89q points (note, that the number of points is a real number).

773D "Perishable Roads" "dp,graphs,shortest paths" "In the country of Never, there are n cities and a well-developed road system. There is exactly one bidirectional road between every pair of cities, thus, there are as many as  roads! No two roads intersect, and no road passes through intermediate cities. The art of building tunnels and bridges has been mastered by Neverians.An independent committee has evaluated each road of Never with a positive integer called the perishability of the road. The lower the road\'s perishability is, the more pleasant it is to drive through this road.It\'s the year of transport in Never. It has been decided to build a museum of transport in one of the cities, and to set a single signpost directing to some city (not necessarily the one with the museum) in each of the other cities. The signposts must satisfy the following important condition: if any Neverian living in a city without the museum starts travelling from that city following the directions of the signposts, then this person will eventually arrive in the city with the museum.Neverians are incredibly positive-minded. If a Neverian travels by a route consisting of several roads, he considers the perishability of the route to be equal to the smallest perishability of all the roads in this route.The government of Never has not yet decided where to build the museum, so they consider all n possible options. The most important is the sum of perishabilities of the routes to the museum city from all the other cities of Never, if the travelers strictly follow the directions of the signposts. The government of Never cares about their citizens, so they want to set the signposts in a way which minimizes this sum. Help them determine the minimum possible sum for all n possible options of the city where the museum can be built." 2700

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.For this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.Pay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x894, and the problem\'s maximum point value is equal to 1500.If the problem\'s maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant\'s correct submission, the participant loses x\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x89250 points.

It\'s also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.With two seconds until the end of the round, all participants\' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.Unfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems.

Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn\'t want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.Find the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya\'s assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can\'t achieve his goal." 2000

Doing this splits the tree and forms a forest. The node which is removed is not a part of the forest.The root of a tree in the forest is the node in that tree which does not have a parent. We define the strength of the forest as the size of largest tree in forest.Jon Snow wants to minimize the strength of the forest. To do this he can perform the following operation at most once.He removes the edge between a node and its parent and inserts a new edge between this node and any other node in forest such that the total number of trees in forest remain same.For each node v you need to find the minimum value of strength of the forest formed when node v is removed." 3300

The rules of this game are quite simple:  The game starts with n piles of stones indexed from 1 to n. The i-th pile contains si stones. The players make their moves alternatively. A move is considered as removal of some number of stones from a pile. Removal of 0 stones does not count as a move. The player who is unable to make a move loses.Now Jon believes that he is ready for battle, but Sam does not think so. To prove his argument, Sam suggested that they play a modified version of the game.In this modified version, no move can be made more than once on a pile. For example, if 4 stones are removed from a pile, 4 stones cannot be removed from that pile again.Sam sets up the game and makes the first move.

There are two types of relations: synonymy (i.ï¿½e. the two words mean the same) and antonymy (i.ï¿½e. the two words mean the opposite). From time to time he discovers a new relation between two words.He know that if two words have a relation between them, then each of them has relations with the words that has relations with the other. For example, if like means love and love is the opposite of hate, then like is also the opposite of hate. One more example: if love is the opposite of hate and hate is the opposite of like, then love means like, and so on.Sometimes Mahmoud discovers a wrong relation. A wrong relation is a relation that makes two words equal and opposite at the same time. For example if he knows that love means like and like is the opposite of hate, and then he figures out that hate means like, the last relation is absolutely wrong because it makes hate and like opposite and have the same meaning at the same time.After Mahmoud figured out many relations, he was worried that some of them were wrong so that they will make other relations also wrong, so he decided to tell every relation he figured out to his coder friend Ehab and for every relation he wanted to know is it correct or wrong, basing on the previously discovered relations.

He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That\'s because this magical paper doesn\'t allow character number i in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than ai. For example, if a1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892 he can\'t write character \'a\' on this paper in a string of length 3 or more. String ""aa"" is allowed while string ""aaa"" is not.Mahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be n and they shouldn\'t overlap. For example, if a1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892 and he wants to send string ""aaa"", he can split it into ""a"" and ""aa"" and use 2 magical papers, or into ""a"", ""a"" and ""a"" and use 3 magical papers. He can\'t split it into ""aa"" and ""aa"" because the sum of their lengths is greater than n. He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.A substring of string s is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string s, strings ""ab"", ""abc"" and ""b"" are substrings of string ""abc"", while strings ""acb"" and ""ac"" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.While Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions:   How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is n and they don\'t overlap? Compute the answer modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.  What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting?  What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in? Two ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ.

Thus, after Timofey starts to feed crows under some tree, all the families that are friends to the family living on this tree, as well as their friends and so on, fly to the feeding place. Of course, the family living on the tree also comes to the feeding place.Today Timofey came to the alley and noticed that all the families that live on trees with numbers strictly less than l or strictly greater than r have flown away. Thus, it is not possible to pass the information about feeding through them. Moreover, there is no need to feed them. Help Timofey to learn what is the minimum number of trees under which he has to feed crows so that all the families that have remained will get the information about feeding. You are given several situations, described by integers l and r, you need to calculate the answer for all of them." 2900

He likes to walk along it. His tree is flat so when he walks along it he sees it entirely. Quite naturally, when he stands on a vertex, he sees the tree as a rooted tree with the root in this vertex.Timofey assumes that the more non-isomorphic subtrees are there in the tree, the more beautiful the tree is. A subtree of a vertex is a subgraph containing this vertex and all its descendants. You should tell Timofey the vertex in which he should stand to see the most beautiful rooted tree.Subtrees of vertices u and v are isomorphic if the number of children of u equals the number of children of v, and their children can be arranged in such a way that the subtree of the first son of u is isomorphic to the subtree of the first son of v, the subtree of the second son of u is isomorphic to the subtree of the second son of v, and so on.

After that Timofey brings the tree to a trash can.Timofey doesn\'t like it when many colors are mixing together. A subtree annoys him if there are vertices of different color in it.

761D "Dasha and Very Difficult Problem" "binary search,brute force,constructive algorithms,greedy,sortings" "Dasha logged into the system and began to solve problems. One of them is as follows:Given two sequences a and b of length n each you need to write a sequence c of length n, the i-th element of which is calculated as follows: ci\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89bi\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89ai.About sequences a and b we know that their elements are in the range from l to r.

About sequence c we know that all its elements are distinct.  Dasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly, but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy. Due to an error in the test system only the sequence a and the compressed sequence of the sequence c were known from that test.Let\'s give the definition to a compressed sequence. A compressed sequence of sequence c of length n is a sequence p of length n, so that pi equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to ci in the sequence c.

The password is a string of length n which satisfies the following requirements:  There is at least one digit in the string,  There is at least one lowercase (small) letter of the Latin alphabet in the string,  There is at least one of three listed symbols in the string: \'#\', \'*\', \'&\'.   Considering that these are programming classes it is not easy to write the password.For each character of the password we have a fixed string of length m, on each of these n strings there is a pointer on some character. The i-th character displayed on the screen is the pointed character in the i-th string. Initially, all pointers are on characters with indexes 1 in the corresponding strings (all positions are numbered starting from one).During one operation Dasha can move a pointer in one string one character to the left or to the right. Strings are cyclic, it means that when we move the pointer which is on the character with index 1 to the left, it moves to the character with the index m, and when we move it to the right from the position m it moves to the position 1.You need to determine the minimum number of operations necessary to make the string displayed on the screen a valid password." 1500

Athlete always run the track in counterclockwise direction if you look on him from above. All barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track. Her friends the parrot Kefa and the leopard Sasha participated in competitions and each of them ran one lap. Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track. Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the n barriers. Thus, each of them wrote n integers in the ascending order, each of them was between 0 and L\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891, inclusively.  Consider an example. Let L\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x898, blue points are barriers, and green points are Kefa\'s start (A) and Sasha\'s start (B). Then Kefa writes down the sequence [2,\xe2\x80\x894,\xe2\x80\x896], and Sasha writes down [1,\xe2\x80\x895,\xe2\x80\x897]. There are several tracks in the country, all of them have same length and same number of barriers, but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks. Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks. Write the program which will check that Kefa\'s and Sasha\'s tracks coincide (it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position).

On a Polycarp\'s website each article has comments feed.Each comment on Polycarp\'s website is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters of English alphabet. Comments have tree-like structure, that means each comment except root comments (comments of the highest level) has exactly one parent comment.When Polycarp wants to save comments to his hard drive he uses the following format. Each comment he writes in the following format:   at first, the text of the comment is written;  after that the number of comments is written, for which this comment is a parent comment (i.ï¿½e. the number of the replies to this comments);  after that the comments for which this comment is a parent comment are written (the writing of these comments uses the same algorithm).  All elements in this format are separated by single comma. Similarly, the comments of the first level are separated by comma.For example, if the comments look like:  then the first comment is written as ""hello,2,ok,0,bye,0"", the second is written as ""test,0"", the third comment is written as ""one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0"". The whole comments feed is written as: ""hello,2,ok,0,bye,0,test,0,one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0"".

740B "Alyona and flowers" "constructive algorithms" "Little Alyona is celebrating Happy Birthday! Her mother has an array of n flowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood of i-th flower is ai. The mood can be positive, zero or negative.Let\'s define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl\'s happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in.For example, consider the case when the mother has 5 flowers, and their moods are equal to 1,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x893,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x894. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892), (3,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x894), (1,\xe2\x80\x893), (1,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x893). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then:   the first flower adds 1\xc2\xb71\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891 to the girl\'s happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,  the second flower adds (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892)\xc2\xb71\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,  the third flower adds 1\xc2\xb72\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,  the fourth flower adds 3\xc2\xb72\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x896, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,  the fifth flower adds (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x894)\xc2\xb70\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890, because he is in no chosen subarrays. Thus, in total 1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89(\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892)\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x892\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x896\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x890\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x897 is added to the girl\'s happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible. Help her do this!Alyona can choose any number of the subarrays, even 0 or all suggested by her mother." 1200
