1333E "Road to 1600" "brute force,constructive algorithms" "Egor wants to achieve a rating of 1600 points on the well-known chess portal ChessForces and he needs your help!Before you start solving the problem, Egor wants to remind you how the chess pieces move. Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an N\xc3\x97N board. Each cell of the board has a number from 1 to N2 in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number 1. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of 1 vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an N\xc3\x97N board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such N\xc3\x97N numbered board, or tell that it doesn\'t exist." 2400

It is well-known that they are good mathematicians. Once at a break, they arranged a challenge for themselves. All children arranged in a row and turned heads either to the left or to the right.Children can do the following: in one second several pairs of neighboring children who are looking at each other can simultaneously turn the head in the opposite direction. For instance, the one who was looking at the right neighbor turns left and vice versa for the second child. Moreover, every second at least one pair of neighboring children performs such action. They are going to finish when there is no pair of neighboring children who are looking at each other. You are given the number nn, the initial arrangement of children and the number kk. You have to find a way for the children to act if they want to finish the process in exactly kk seconds. More formally, for each of the kk moves, you need to output the numbers of the children who turn left during this move.For instance, for the configuration shown below and k=2k=2 children can do the following steps:    At the beginning, two pairs make move: (1,2)(1,2) and (3,4)(3,4). After that, we receive the following configuration:    At the second move pair (2,3)(2,3) makes the move. The final configuration is reached. Good job.   It is guaranteed that if the solution exists, it takes not more than n2n2 ""headturns""." 2100

To establish his power to the neighbouring kingdoms he wants to marry his daughters to the princes of these kingdoms. As a lucky coincidence there are n other kingdoms as well.So Polycarp LXXXIV has enumerated his daughters from 1 to n and the kingdoms from 1 to n. For each daughter he has compiled a list of kingdoms princes of which she wanted to marry.Polycarp LXXXIV is very busy, so he finds a couple for his daughters greedily one after another.For the first daughter he takes the kingdom with the lowest number from her list and marries the daughter to their prince. For the second daughter he takes the kingdom with the lowest number from her list, prince of which hasn\'t been taken already. If there are no free princes in the list then the daughter marries nobody and Polycarp LXXXIV proceeds to the next daughter. The process ends after the n-th daughter.For example, let there be 4 daughters and kingdoms, the lists daughters have are [2,3], [1,2], [3,4], [3], respectively.  In that case daughter 1 marries the prince of kingdom 2, daughter 2 marries the prince of kingdom 1, daughter 3 marries the prince of kingdom 3, leaving daughter 4 nobody to marry to.Actually, before starting the marriage process Polycarp LXXXIV has the time to convince one of his daughters that some prince is also worth marrying to. Effectively, that means that he can add exactly one kingdom to exactly one of his daughter\'s list. Note that this kingdom should not be present in the daughter\'s list.Polycarp LXXXIV wants to increase the number of married couples.Unfortunately, what he doesn\'t have the time for is determining what entry to add. If there is no way to increase the total number of married couples then output that the marriages are already optimal. Otherwise, find such an entry that the total number of married couples increases if Polycarp LXXXIV adds it.If there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them.For your and our convenience you are asked to answer t independent test cases." 1200

Each metro line the mayor wants to create is a simple path between stations ai and bi. Metro lines can intersects freely, that is, they can share common stations or even common tunnels. However, it\'s not yet decided which of two directions each line will go. More precisely, between the stations ai and bi the trains will go either from ai to bi, or from bi to ai, but not simultaneously.The city M uses complicated faring rules. Each station is assigned with a positive integer ci \xe2\x80\x94 the fare zone of the station. The cost of travel from v to u is defined as cu\xe2\x88\x92cv roubles. Of course, such travel only allowed in case there is a metro line, the trains on which go from v to u. Mayor doesn\'t want to have any travels with a negative cost, so it was decided to assign directions of metro lines and station fare zones in such a way, that fare zones are strictly increasing during any travel on any metro line.Mayor wants firstly assign each station a fare zone and then choose a lines direction, such that all fare zones are increasing along any line. In connection with the approaching celebration of the day of the city, the mayor wants to assign fare zones so that the maximum ci will be as low as possible.

""Median mountain range"" is famous for the so called alignment of mountain peaks happening to it every day. At the moment of alignment simultaneously for each mountain from 2 to n\xe2\x88\x921 its height becomes equal to the median height among it and two neighboring mountains.

The median of three integers is the second largest number among them. For example, median(5,1,2)=2, and median(4,2,4)=4.Recently, Berland scientists have proved that whatever are the current heights of the mountains, the alignment process will stabilize sooner or later, i.e. at some point the altitude of the mountains won\'t changing after the alignment any more. The government of Berland wants to understand how soon it will happen, i.e. to find the value of c \xe2\x80\x94 how many alignments will occur, which will change the height of at least one mountain.

You may perform several operations on this string.In one operation, you can choose some index i and remove the i-th character of s (si) if at least one of its adjacent characters is the previous letter in the Latin alphabet for si. For example, the previous letter for b is a, the previous letter for s is r, the letter a has no previous letters. Note that after each removal the length of the string decreases by one.

The first and the last characters of s both have only one adjacent character (unless |s|=1).Consider the following example. Let s= bacabcab.  During the first move, you can remove the first character s1= b because s2= a. Then the string becomes s= acabcab.  During the second move, you can remove the fifth character s5= c because s4= b. Then the string becomes s= acabab.  During the third move, you can remove the sixth character s6=\'b\' because s5= a. Then the string becomes s= acaba.  During the fourth move, the only character you can remove is s4= b, because s3= a (or s5= a). The string becomes s= acaa and you cannot do anything with it. Your task is to find the maximum possible number of characters you can remove if you choose the sequence of operations optimally." 1600

These blocks are unaffected by gravity, so they can float in the air without support. The blocks are placed in cells of size 1\xc3\x971\xc3\x971; each cell either contains exactly one block or is empty. Each cell is represented by its coordinates (x,y,z) (the cell with these coordinates is a cube with opposite corners in (x,y,z) and (x+1,y+1,z+1)) and its contents ax,y,z; if the cell is empty, then ax,y,z=0, otherwise ax,y,z is equal to the type of the block placed in it (the types are integers from 1 to 2\xe2\x8b\x85105).Polycarp has built a large structure consisting of blocks. This structure can be enclosed in an axis-aligned rectangular parallelepiped of size n\xc3\x97m\xc3\x97k, containing all cells (x,y,z) such that x\xe2\x88\x88[1,n], y\xe2\x88\x88[1,m], and z\xe2\x88\x88[1,k]. After that, Polycarp has installed 2nm+2nk+2mk sensors around this parallelepiped. A sensor is a special block that sends a ray in some direction and shows the type of the first block that was hit by this ray (except for other sensors). The sensors installed by Polycarp are adjacent to the borders of the parallelepiped, and the rays sent by them are parallel to one of the coordinate axes and directed inside the parallelepiped. More formally, the sensors can be divided into 6 types:  there are mk sensors of the first type; each such sensor is installed in (0,y,z), where y\xe2\x88\x88[1,m] and z\xe2\x88\x88[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Ox axis and has the same direction;  there are mk sensors of the second type; each such sensor is installed in (n+1,y,z), where y\xe2\x88\x88[1,m] and z\xe2\x88\x88[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Ox axis and has the opposite direction;  there are nk sensors of the third type; each such sensor is installed in (x,0,z), where x\xe2\x88\x88[1,n] and z\xe2\x88\x88[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oy axis and has the same direction;  there are nk sensors of the fourth type; each such sensor is installed in (x,m+1,z), where x\xe2\x88\x88[1,n] and z\xe2\x88\x88[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oy axis and has the opposite direction;  there are nm sensors of the fifth type; each such sensor is installed in (x,y,0), where x\xe2\x88\x88[1,n] and y\xe2\x88\x88[1,m], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oz axis and has the same direction;  finally, there are nm sensors of the sixth type; each such sensor is installed in (x,y,k+1), where x\xe2\x88\x88[1,n] and y\xe2\x88\x88[1,m], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oz axis and has the opposite direction. Polycarp has invited his friend Monocarp to play with him. Of course, as soon as Monocarp saw a large parallelepiped bounded by sensor blocks, he began to wonder what was inside of it. Polycarp didn\'t want to tell Monocarp the exact shape of the figure, so he provided Monocarp with the data from all sensors and told him to try guessing the contents of the parallelepiped by himself.After some hours of thinking, Monocarp has no clue about what\'s inside the sensor-bounded space.

After virus ki spreads, the process starts again from virus 1.A spread turn of virus j proceeds as follows. For each city x not infected with any virus at the start of the turn, at the end of the turn it becomes infected with virus j if and only if there is such a city y that: city y was infected with virus j at the start of the turn; the path between cities x and y contains at most sj edges; all cities on the path between cities x and y (excluding y) were uninfected with any virus at the start of the turn.Once a city is infected with a virus, it stays infected indefinitely and can not be infected with any other virus.

The characters of each string are numbered from 1.We can perform several operations on the strings we consider.

1320B "Navigation System" "dfs and similar,graphs,shortest paths" "The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of n intersections, numbered from 1 to n and connected by m one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection v to another intersection u is the path that starts in v, ends in u and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection s and works in a building near the intersection t. Every day he gets from s to t by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1=s, pk=t, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp\'s path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from s to t.Polycarp\'s car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let\'s describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection s, the system chooses some shortest path from s to t and shows it to Polycarp. Let\'s denote the next intersection in the chosen path as v. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from s to v, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from v as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection w instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at w, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from w to t and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at t: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path [1,2,3,4] (s=1, t=4): Check the picture by the link http://tk.codeforces.com/a.png   When Polycarp starts at 1, the system chooses some shortest path from 1 to 4. There is only one such path, it is [1,5,4];  Polycarp chooses to drive to 2, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at 2, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from 2 to 4, for example, [2,6,4] (note that it could choose [2,3,4]);  Polycarp chooses to drive to 3, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at 3, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from 3 to 4, which is [3,4];  Polycarp arrives at 4 along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. Overall, we get 2 rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose [2,3,4] instead of [2,6,4] during the second step, there would be only 1 rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path [3,4] during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same. Given this information (the map and Polycarp\'s path), can you determine the minimum and the maximum number of rebuilds that could have happened during the journey?" 1700

If the character is R, the player should move to the right cell (r,c+1), for L the player should move to the left cell (r,c\xe2\x88\x921), for U the player should move to the top cell (r\xe2\x88\x921,c), for D the player should move to the bottom cell (r+1,c). Finally, if the character in the cell is X, then this cell is the blocked zone. The player should remain in this cell (the game for him isn\'t very interesting from now on).It is guaranteed that the characters are written in a way that the player will never have to step outside of the board, no matter at which cell he starts.As a player starts from a cell, he moves according to the character in the current cell. The player keeps moving until he lands in a blocked zone. It is also possible that the player will keep moving infinitely long.For every of the n2 cells of the board Alice, your friend, wants to know, how will the game go, if the player starts in this cell. For each starting cell of the board, she writes down the cell that the player stops at, or that the player never stops at all. She gives you the information she has written: for each cell (r,c) she wrote:   a pair (x,y), meaning if a player had started at (r,c), he would end up at cell (x,y).  or a pair (\xe2\x88\x921,\xe2\x88\x921), meaning if a player had started at (r,c), he would keep moving infinitely long and would never enter the blocked zone. It might be possible that Alice is trying to fool you and there\'s no possible grid that satisfies all the constraints Alice gave you. For the given information Alice provided you, you are required to decipher a possible board, or to determine that such a board doesn\'t exist. If there exist several different boards that satisfy the provided information, you can find any of them." 2000

The mixed attack can be launched at any valid target (at any castle with at least one soldier). However, the infantry attack cannot be launched if the previous attack on the targeted castle had the same type, no matter when and by whom it was launched. The same applies to the cavalry attack. A castle that was not attacked at all can be targeted by any type of attack.The King who launches the last attack will be glorified as the conqueror of the Red Kingdom, so both Kings want to launch the last attack (and they are wise enough to find a strategy that allows them to do it no matter what are the actions of their opponent, if such strategy exists).

It is formulated as follows:  Let\'s fix a finite field and two it\'s elements a and b. One need to fun such x that ax=b or detect there is no such x. It is most likely that modern mankind cannot solve the problem of discrete logarithm for a sufficiently large field size. For example, for a field of residues modulo prime number, primes of 1024 or 2048 bits are considered to be safe. However, calculations with such large numbers can place a significant load on servers that perform cryptographic operations. For this reason, instead of a simple module residue field, more complex fields are often used. For such field no fast algorithms that use a field structure are known, smaller fields can be used and operations can be properly optimized. Developer Nikolai does not trust the generally accepted methods, so he wants to invent his own. Recently, he read about a very strange field \xe2\x80\x94 nimbers, and thinks it\'s a great fit for the purpose.

One of ways to define multiplication operation (\xe2\x8a\x99) is following properties:   0\xe2\x8a\x99a=a\xe2\x8a\x990=0  1\xe2\x8a\x99a=a\xe2\x8a\x991=a  a\xe2\x8a\x99b=b\xe2\x8a\x99a  a\xe2\x8a\x99(b\xe2\x8a\x99c)=(a\xe2\x8a\x99b)\xe2\x8a\x99c  a\xe2\x8a\x99(b\xe2\x8a\x95c)=(a\xe2\x8a\x99b)\xe2\x8a\x95(a\xe2\x8a\x99c)  If a=22n for some integer n>0, and b<a, then a\xe2\x8a\x99b=a\xe2\x8b\x85b.  If a=22n for some integer n>0, then a\xe2\x8a\x99a=32\xe2\x8b\x85a. For example:   4\xe2\x8a\x994=6  8\xe2\x8a\x998=4\xe2\x8a\x992\xe2\x8a\x994\xe2\x8a\x992=4\xe2\x8a\x994\xe2\x8a\x992\xe2\x8a\x992=6\xe2\x8a\x993=(4\xe2\x8a\x952)\xe2\x8a\x993=(4\xe2\x8a\x993)\xe2\x8a\x95(2\xe2\x8a\x99(2\xe2\x8a\x951))=(4\xe2\x8a\x993)\xe2\x8a\x95(2\xe2\x8a\x992)\xe2\x8a\x95(2\xe2\x8a\x991)=12\xe2\x8a\x953\xe2\x8a\x952=13.  32\xe2\x8a\x9964=(16\xe2\x8a\x992)\xe2\x8a\x99(16\xe2\x8a\x994)=(16\xe2\x8a\x9916)\xe2\x8a\x99(2\xe2\x8a\x994)=24\xe2\x8a\x998=(16\xe2\x8a\x958)\xe2\x8a\x998=(16\xe2\x8a\x998)\xe2\x8a\x95(8\xe2\x8a\x998)=128\xe2\x8a\x9513=141  5\xe2\x8a\x996=(4\xe2\x8a\x951)\xe2\x8a\x99(4\xe2\x8a\x952)=(4\xe2\x8a\x994)\xe2\x8a\x95(4\xe2\x8a\x992)\xe2\x8a\x95(4\xe2\x8a\x991)\xe2\x8a\x95(1\xe2\x8a\x992)=6\xe2\x8a\x958\xe2\x8a\x954\xe2\x8a\x952=8 Formally, this algorithm can be described by following pseudo-code. multiply(a, b) {   ans = 0   for p1 in bits(a)       // numbers of bits of a equal to one       for p2 in bits(b)   // numbers of bits of b equal to one          ans = ans xor multiply_powers_of_2(1 << p1, 1 << p2)   return ans;}multiply_powers_of_2(a, b) {    if (a == 1 or b == 1) return a * b    n = maximal value, such 2^{2^{n}} <= max(a, b)    power = 2^{2^{n}};    if (a >= power and b >= power) {        return multiply(power * 3 / 2, multiply_powers_of_2(a / power, b / power))    } else if (a >= power) {        return multiply_powers_of_2(a / power, b) * power    } else {        return multiply_powers_of_2(a, b / power) * power    }}It can be shown, that this operations really forms a field. Moreover, than can make sense as game theory operations, but that\'s not related to problem much.

When a cow feeds, it walks towards the other end without changing direction and eats grass of its favorite sweetness until it eats hi units.  The moment a cow eats hi units, it will fall asleep there, preventing further cows from passing it from both directions.  If it encounters another sleeping cow or reaches the end of the grass row, it will get upset. Farmer John absolutely does not want any cows to get upset. Note that grass does not grow back. Also, to prevent cows from getting upset, not every cow has to feed since FJ can choose a subset of them. Surprisingly, FJ has determined that sleeping cows are the most satisfied. If FJ orders optimally, what is the maximum number of sleeping cows that can result, and how many ways can FJ choose the subset of cows on the left and right side to achieve that maximum number of sleeping cows (modulo 109+7)?

For example, the strings () and (()) are simple, while the strings )( and ()() are not simple.Kuroni will be given a string formed by characters \'(\' and \')\' (the given string is not necessarily simple).

Give the first necklace and the third bracelet to the second daughter, for a total brightness of a1+b3=3.

If he starts recording on the n-th day with one of the cameras, the camera records for only one day. Each camera can observe k consecutive areas of the forest. For example, if m=5 and k=3, he can put a camera to observe one of these three ranges of areas for two days: [1,3], [2,4], and [3,5].Gildong got information about how many animals will be seen in each area each day. Since he would like to observe as many animals as possible, he wants you to find the best way to place the two cameras for n days. Note that if the two cameras are observing the same area on the same day, the animals observed in that area are counted only once." 2300
1304E "1-Trees and Queries" "data structures,dfs and similar,shortest paths,trees" "Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he\'s going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.First, he\'ll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you\'re asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query." 2000
1304D "Shortest and Longest LIS" "constructive algorithms,graphs,greedy,two pointers" "Gildong recently learned how to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in O(nlogn) time for a sequence of length n. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn\'t find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he\'s going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of n distinct integers between 1 and n, inclusive, to test his code with your output.The quiz is as follows.Gildong provides a string of length n\xe2\x88\x921, consisting of characters \'<\' and \'>\' only. The i-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the i-th element and the i+1-st element of the sequence. If the i-th character of the string is \'<\', then the i-th element of the sequence is less than the i+1-st element. If the i-th character of the string is \'>\', then the i-th element of the sequence is greater than the i+1-st element.He wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of n distinct integers between 1 and n, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible." 1800
1304C "Air Conditioner" "dp,greedy,implementation,sortings,two pointers" "Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers\' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it\'s off, the restaurant\'s temperature remains the same. When it\'s heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it\'s cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.Each customer is characterized by three values: ti \xe2\x80\x94 the time (in minutes) when the i-th customer visits the restaurant, li \xe2\x80\x94 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and hi \xe2\x80\x94 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the i-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between li and hi (inclusive) in the ti-th minute.Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers\' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you\'re going to help him find if it\'s possible to satisfy all customers." 1500
1304B "Longest Palindrome" "brute force,constructive algorithms,greedy,implementation,strings" "Returning back to problem solving, Gildong is now studying about palindromes. He learned that a palindrome is a string that is the same as its reverse. For example, strings ""pop"", ""noon"", ""x"", and ""kkkkkk"" are palindromes, while strings ""moon"", ""tv"", and ""abab"" are not. An empty string is also a palindrome.Gildong loves this concept so much, so he wants to play with it. He has n distinct strings of equal length m. He wants to discard some of the strings (possibly none or all) and reorder the remaining strings so that the concatenation becomes a palindrome. He also wants the palindrome to be as long as possible. Please help him find one." 1100
1304A "Two Rabbits" math "Being tired of participating in too many Codeforces rounds, Gildong decided to take some rest in a park. He sat down on a bench, and soon he found two rabbits hopping around. One of the rabbits was taller than the other.He noticed that the two rabbits were hopping towards each other. The positions of the two rabbits can be represented as integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The taller rabbit is currently on position x, and the shorter rabbit is currently on position y (x<y). Every second, each rabbit hops to another position. The taller rabbit hops to the positive direction by a, and the shorter rabbit hops to the negative direction by b.  For example, let\'s say x=0, y=10, a=2, and b=3. At the 1-st second, each rabbit will be at position 2 and 7. At the 2-nd second, both rabbits will be at position 4.Gildong is now wondering: Will the two rabbits be at the same position at the same moment? If so, how long will it take? Let\'s find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the rabbits will be at the same point." 800

He doesn\'t like to move his fingers while typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in s, they should be adjacent on the keyboard.

You have been assigned to select an arbitrary subset of cities S to upgrade (potentially all the cities) that satisfies the following requirements:  the subset of cities must be ""connected"", that is, from any city of the subset S you can get to any other city of the subset S by roads, moving only through cities from S,  the number of ""dead-ends"" in S must be equal to the given number k. A city is a ""dead-end"" if it is the only city in S or connected to exactly one another city from S.

The company that created this robot asked you to optimize the path of the robot somehow. To do this, you can remove any non-empty substring of the path.

It is possible that you can\'t optimize the path. Also, it is possible that after the optimization the target path is an empty string (i.e. deleted substring is the whole string s).Recall that the substring of s is such string that can be obtained from s by removing some amount of characters (possibly, zero) from the prefix and some amount of characters (possibly, zero) from the suffix.

This network contains exactly n\xe2\x88\x921 direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from 0 to n\xe2\x88\x922 such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass S password layers, with S being defined by the following formula:S=\xe2\x88\x911\xe2\x89\xa4u<v\xe2\x89\xa4nmex(u,v)Here, mex(u,v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang u to gang v.Xenon doesn\'t know the way the integers are assigned, but it\'s not a problem.

Segments can degenerate into points, that is li=ri is possible.Union of the set of segments is such a set of segments which covers exactly the same set of points as the original set. For example:  if n=3 and there are segments [3,6], [100,100], [5,8] then their union is 2 segments: [3,8] and [100,100];  if n=5 and there are segments [1,2], [2,3], [4,5], [4,6], [6,6] then their union is 2 segments: [1,3] and [4,6]. Obviously, a union is a set of pairwise non-intersecting segments.You are asked to erase exactly one segment of the given n so that the number of segments in the union of the rest n\xe2\x88\x921 segments is maximum possible.For example, if n=4 and there are segments [1,4], [2,3], [3,6], [5,7], then:  erasing the first segment will lead to [2,3], [3,6], [5,7] remaining, which have 1 segment in their union;  erasing the second segment will lead to [1,4], [3,6], [5,7] remaining, which have 1 segment in their union;  erasing the third segment will lead to [1,4], [2,3], [5,7] remaining, which have 2 segments in their union;  erasing the fourth segment will lead to [1,4], [2,3], [3,6] remaining, which have 1 segment in their union. Thus, you are required to erase the third segment to get answer 2.Write a program that will find the maximum number of segments in the union of n\xe2\x88\x921 segments if you erase any of the given n segments.Note that if there are multiple equal segments in the given set, then you can erase only one of them anyway.

To make the gathering more fun for the kids, Jaehyun is going to run a game of hide-and-seek.The garden can be represented by a n\xc3\x97m grid of unit cells. Some (possibly zero) cells are blocked by rocks, and the remaining cells are free. Two cells are neighbors if they share an edge. Each cell has up to 4 neighbors: two in the horizontal direction and two in the vertical direction. Since the garden is represented as a grid, we can classify the cells in the garden as either ""black"" or ""white"". The top-left cell is black, and two cells which are neighbors must be different colors. Cell indices are 1-based, so the top-left corner of the garden is cell (1,1).Jaehyun wants to turn his garden into a maze by placing some walls between two cells. Walls can only be placed between neighboring cells. If the wall is placed between two neighboring cells a and b, then the two cells a and b are not neighboring from that point. One can walk directly between two neighboring cells if and only if there is no wall directly between them. A maze must have the following property. For each pair of free cells in the maze, there must be exactly one simple path between them. A simple path between cells a and b is a sequence of free cells in which the first cell is a, the last cell is b, all cells are distinct, and any two consecutive cells are neighbors which are not directly blocked by a wall.At first, kids will gather in cell (1,1), and start the hide-and-seek game. A kid can hide in a cell if and only if that cell is free, it is not (1,1), and has exactly one free neighbor. Jaehyun planted roses in the black cells, so it\'s dangerous if the kids hide there. So Jaehyun wants to create a maze where the kids can only hide in white cells.You are given the map of the garden as input. Your task is to help Jaehyun create a maze." 3300

If a system breaks down, exactly one edge e\xe2\x88\x88T1 becomes unusable. In this case, Donghyun will protect the edge e by picking another edge f\xe2\x88\x88T2, and add it to the existing network. This new edge should make the network be connected again. Donghyun wants to assign a replacement edge f\xe2\x88\x88T2 for as many edges e\xe2\x88\x88T1 as possible. However, since the backup network T2 is fragile, f\xe2\x88\x88T2 can be assigned as the replacement edge for at most one edge in T1.

If the conference is situated in venue a, the lecture will be held from sai to eai, and if the conference is situated in venue b, the lecture will be held from sbi to ebi. Hyunuk will choose one of these venues and all lectures will be held at that venue.Two lectures are said to overlap if they share any point in time in common. Formally, a lecture held in interval [x,y] overlaps with a lecture held in interval [u,v] if and only if max(x,u)\xe2\x89\xa4min(y,v).We say that a participant can attend a subset s of the lectures if the lectures in s do not pairwise overlap (i.e. no two lectures overlap). Note that the possibility of attending may depend on whether Hyunuk selected venue a or venue b to hold the conference.A subset of lectures s is said to be venue-sensitive if, for one of the venues, the participant can attend s, but for the other venue, the participant cannot attend s.A venue-sensitive set is problematic for a participant who is interested in attending the lectures in s because the participant cannot be sure whether the lecture times will overlap.

For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).A sequence a is a subsegment of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. We will denote the subsegments as [l,r], where l,r are two integers with 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n. This indicates the subsegment where l\xe2\x88\x921 elements from the beginning and n\xe2\x88\x92r elements from the end are deleted from the sequence.For a permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn, we define a framed segment as a subsegment [l,r] where max{pl,pl+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,pr}\xe2\x88\x92min{pl,pl+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,pr}=r\xe2\x88\x92l. For example, for the permutation (6,7,1,8,5,3,2,4) some of its framed segments are: [1,2],[5,8],[6,7],[3,3],[8,8]. In particular, a subsegment [i,i] is always a framed segments for any i between 1 and n, inclusive.We define the happiness of a permutation p as the number of pairs (l,r) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n, and [l,r] is a framed segment.

Obviously, each lamp has at most one wire that brings power to it (and this lamp is the auxiliary lamp for this wire, and the main lamp for all other wires connected directly to it).Each lamp has a brightness value associated with it, the i-th lamp has brightness 2i.

1282E "The Cake Is a Lie" "constructive algorithms,data structures,dfs and similar,graphs" "We are committed to the well being of all participants. Therefore, instead of the problem, we suggest you enjoy a piece of cake.Uh oh. Somebody cut the cake. We told them to wait for you, but they did it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back. Of course, before you taste the cake, you thought about how the cake was cut.It is known that the cake was originally a regular n-sided polygon, each vertex of which had a unique number from 1 to n. The vertices were numbered in random order.Each piece of the cake is a triangle. The cake was cut into n\xe2\x88\x922 pieces as follows: each time one cut was made with a knife (from one vertex to another) such that exactly one triangular piece was separated from the current cake, and the rest continued to be a convex polygon. In other words, each time three consecutive vertices of the polygon were selected and the corresponding triangle was cut off.A possible process of cutting the cake is presented in the picture below.  Example of 6-sided cake slicing. You are given a set of n\xe2\x88\x922 triangular pieces in random order. The vertices of each piece are given in random order \xe2\x80\x94 clockwise or counterclockwise. Each piece is defined by three numbers \xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of the corresponding n-sided cake vertices.For example, for the situation in the picture above, you could be given a set of pieces: [3,6,5],[5,2,4],[5,4,6],[6,3,1].You are interested in two questions.  What was the enumeration of the n-sided cake vertices?  In what order were the pieces cut? Formally, you have to find two permutations p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n) and q1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qn\xe2\x88\x922 (1\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x922) such that if the cake vertices are numbered with the numbers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn in order clockwise or counterclockwise, then when cutting pieces of the cake in the order q1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qn\xe2\x88\x922 always cuts off a triangular piece so that the remaining part forms one convex polygon.For example, in the picture above the answer permutations could be: p=[2,4,6,1,3,5] (or any of its cyclic shifts, or its reversal and after that any cyclic shift) and q=[2,4,1,3].Write a program that, based on the given triangular pieces, finds any suitable permutations p and q." 2400
1282D "Enchanted Artifact" "constructive algorithms,interactive,strings" "This is an interactive problem.After completing the last level of the enchanted temple, you received a powerful artifact of the 255th level. Do not rush to celebrate, because this artifact has a powerful rune that can be destroyed with a single spell s, which you are going to find. We define the spell as some non-empty string consisting only of the letters a and b.At any time, you can cast an arbitrary non-empty spell t, and the rune on the artifact will begin to resist. Resistance of the rune is the edit distance between the strings that specify the casted spell t and the rune-destroying spell s.Edit distance of two strings s and t is a value equal to the minimum number of one-character operations of replacing, inserting and deleting characters in s to get t. For example, the distance between ababa and aaa is 2, the distance between aaa and aba is 1, the distance between bbaba and abb is 3. The edit distance is 0 if and only if the strings are equal.It is also worth considering that the artifact has a resistance limit  \xe2\x80\x94 if you cast more than n+2 spells, where n is the length of spell s, the rune will be blocked.Thus, it takes n+2 or fewer spells to destroy the rune that is on your artifact. Keep in mind that the required destructive spell s must also be counted among these n+2 spells.Note that the length n of the rune-destroying spell s is not known to you in advance. It is only known that its length n does not exceed 300." 2300
1282C "Petya and Exam" "greedy,sortings,two pointers" "Petya has come to the math exam and wants to solve as many problems as possible. He prepared and carefully studied the rules by which the exam passes.The exam consists of n problems that can be solved in T minutes. Thus, the exam begins at time 0 and ends at time T. Petya can leave the exam at any integer time from 0 to T, inclusive.All problems are divided into two types:   easy problems \xe2\x80\x94 Petya takes exactly a minutes to solve any easy problem;  hard problems \xe2\x80\x94 Petya takes exactly b minutes (b>a) to solve any hard problem. Thus, if Petya starts solving an easy problem at time x, then it will be solved at time x+a. Similarly, if at a time x Petya starts to solve a hard problem, then it will be solved at time x+b.For every problem, Petya knows if it is easy or hard. Also, for each problem is determined time ti (0\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4T) at which it will become mandatory (required). If Petya leaves the exam at time s and there is such a problem i that ti\xe2\x89\xa4s and he didn\'t solve it, then he will receive 0 points for the whole exam. Otherwise (i.e if he has solved all such problems for which ti\xe2\x89\xa4s) he will receive a number of points equal to the number of solved problems. Note that leaving at time s Petya can have both ""mandatory"" and ""non-mandatory"" problems solved.For example, if n=2, T=5, a=2, b=3, the first problem is hard and t1=3 and the second problem is easy and t2=2. Then:  if he leaves at time s=0, then he will receive 0 points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time s=1, he will receive 0 points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time s=2, then he can get a 1 point by solving the problem with the number 2 (it must be solved in the range from 0 to 2);  if he leaves at time s=3, then he will receive 0 points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time s=4, then he will receive 0 points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time s=5, then he can get 2 points by solving all problems. Thus, the answer to this test is 2.Help Petya to determine the maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam." 1800

For example, here is how the organs of a healthy such alien would be positioned, when viewed from the top, for k=4:  Here, the E represents empty space. In general, the first row contains organs 1 to 2k+1 (in that order from left to right), and the second row contains organs 2k+2 to 4k+1 (in that order from left to right) and then empty space right after. Your patient\'s organs are complete, and inside their body, but they somehow got shuffled around! Your job, as an intergalactic surgeon, is to put everything back in its correct position. All organs of the alien must be in its body during the entire procedure. This means that at any point during the procedure, there is exactly one cell (in the grid) that is empty. In addition, you can only move organs around by doing one of the following things:  You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate left or to its immediate right (if they exist). In reality, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space;  You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate top or its immediate bottom (if they exist) only if the empty space is on the leftmost column, rightmost column or in the centermost column.

You plan to create a program that will optimize the circuits while keeping the same circuit layout and maintaining the same effective resistance.A circuit has two endpoints, and is associated with a certain constant, RR, called its effective resistance. The circuits we\'ll consider will be formed from individual resistors joined together in series or in parallel, forming more complex circuits. The following image illustrates combining circuits in series or parallel.   According to your friend Kirchhoff, the effective resistance can be calculated quite easily when joining circuits this way:  When joining kk circuits in series with effective resistances R1,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RkR1,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Rk, the effective resistance RR of the resulting circuit is the sum R=R1+R2+\xe2\x80\xa6+Rk.R=R1+R2+\xe2\x80\xa6+Rk.  When joining kk circuits in parallel with effective resistances R1,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RkR1,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Rk, the effective resistance RR of the resulting circuit is found by solving for RR in 1R=1R1+1R2+\xe2\x80\xa6+1Rk,1R=1R1+1R2+\xe2\x80\xa6+1Rk, assuming all Ri>0Ri>0; if at least one Ri=0Ri=0, then the effective resistance of the whole circuit is simply R=0R=0.

Then we do the following: while there is at least one not marked element in p, we find the leftmost such element, list all elements that are reachable from it in the order they appear in p, mark all of these elements, then cyclically shift the list of those elements so that the maximum appears at the first position, and add this list as an element of l. After all elements are marked, l is the result of this decomposition.For example, if we want to build a decomposition of p=[5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6], we do the following:  initially p=[5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6] (bold elements are marked), l=[];  the leftmost unmarked element is 5; 5 and 1 are reachable from it, so the list we want to shift is [5,1]; there is no need to shift it, since maximum is already the first element;  p=[5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6], l=[[5,1]];  the leftmost unmarked element is 4, the list of reachable elements is [4,2,3]; the maximum is already the first element, so there\'s no need to shift it;  p=[5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6], l=[[5,1],[4,2,3]];  the leftmost unmarked element is 7, the list of reachable elements is [7,8,6]; we have to shift it, so it becomes [8,6,7];  p=[5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6], l=[[5,1],[4,2,3],[8,6,7]];  all elements are marked, so [[5,1],[4,2,3],[8,6,7]] is the result. The New Year transformation of a permutation is defined as follows: we build the decomposition of this permutation; then we sort all lists in decomposition in ascending order of the first elements (we don\'t swap the elements in these lists, only the lists themselves); then we concatenate the lists into one list which becomes a new permutation. For example, the New Year transformation of p=[5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6] is built as follows:  the decomposition is [[5,1],[4,2,3],[8,6,7]];  after sorting the decomposition, it becomes [[4,2,3],[5,1],[8,6,7]];  [4,2,3,5,1,8,6,7] is the result of the transformation. We call a permutation good if the result of its transformation is the same as the permutation itself. For example, [4,3,1,2,8,5,6,7] is a good permutation; and [5,4,2,3,1,7,8,6] is bad, since the result of transformation is [4,2,3,5,1,8,6,7].Your task is the following: given n and k, find the k-th (lexicographically) good permutation of length n." 2700
1279D "Santa\'s Bot" combinatorics,math,probabilities "Santa Claus has received letters from n different kids throughout this year. Of course, each kid wants to get some presents from Santa: in particular, the i-th kid asked Santa to give them one of ki different items as a present. Some items could have been asked by multiple kids.Santa is really busy, so he wants the New Year Bot to choose the presents for all children. Unfortunately, the Bot\'s algorithm of choosing presents is bugged. To choose a present for some kid, the Bot does the following:  choose one kid x equiprobably among all n kids;  choose some item y equiprobably among all kx items kid x wants;  choose a kid z who will receive the present equipropably among all n kids (this choice is independent of choosing x and y); the resulting triple (x,y,z) is called the decision of the Bot. If kid z listed item y as an item they want to receive, then the decision valid. Otherwise, the Bot\'s choice is invalid.Santa is aware of the bug, but he can\'t estimate if this bug is really severe. To do so, he wants to know the probability that one decision generated according to the aforementioned algorithm is valid. Can you help him?" 1700
1279C "Stack of Presents" "data structures,implementation" "Santa has to send presents to the kids. He has a large stack of n presents, numbered from 1 to n; the topmost present has number a1, the next present is a2, and so on; the bottom present has number an. All numbers are distinct.Santa has a list of m distinct presents he has to send: b1, b2, ..., bm. He will send them in the order they appear in the list.To send a present, Santa has to find it in the stack by removing all presents above it, taking this present and returning all removed presents on top of the stack. So, if there are k presents above the present Santa wants to send, it takes him 2k+1 seconds to do it. Fortunately, Santa can speed the whole process up \xe2\x80\x94 when he returns the presents to the stack, he may reorder them as he wishes (only those which were above the present he wanted to take; the presents below cannot be affected in any way).What is the minimum time required to send all of the presents, provided that Santa knows the whole list of presents he has to send and reorders the presents optimally?

After reciting the verse, Vasya will get the number of presents equal to the number of parts he fully recited.Vasya can skip at most one part of the verse while reciting it (if he skips more than one part, then Santa will definitely notice it).Santa will listen to Vasya\'s verse for no more than s seconds. For example, if s=10, a=[100,9,1,1], and Vasya skips the first part of verse, then he gets two presents.Note that it is possible to recite the whole verse (if there is enough time). Determine which part Vasya needs to skip to obtain the maximum possible number of gifts. If Vasya shouldn\'t skip anything, print 0.

1279A "New Year Garland" math "Polycarp is sad \xe2\x80\x94 New Year is coming in few days but there is still no snow in his city. To bring himself New Year mood, he decided to decorate his house with some garlands.The local store introduced a new service this year, called ""Build your own garland"". So you can buy some red, green and blue lamps, provide them and the store workers will solder a single garland of them. The resulting garland will have all the lamps you provided put in a line. Moreover, no pair of lamps of the same color will be adjacent to each other in this garland!For example, if you provide 3 red, 3 green and 3 blue lamps, the resulting garland can look like this: ""RGBRBGBGR"" (""RGB"" being the red, green and blue color, respectively). Note that it\'s ok to have lamps of the same color on the ends of the garland.However, if you provide, say, 1 red, 10 green and 2 blue lamps then the store workers won\'t be able to build any garland of them. Any garland consisting of these lamps will have at least one pair of lamps of the same color adjacent to each other. Note that the store workers should use all the lamps you provided.So Polycarp has bought some sets of lamps and now he wants to know if the store workers can build a garland from each of them." 900

So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly n jars to his left and n jars to his right.For example, the basement might look like this:  Being the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right.Finally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same.For example, this might be the result:  He has eaten 1 jar to his left and then 5 jars to his right. There remained exactly 3 full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam. Jars are numbered from 1 to 2n from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars n and n+1.What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left?Your program should answer t independent test cases." 1700

1272B "Snow Walking Robot" "constructive algorithms,greedy,implementation" "Recently you have bought a snow walking robot and brought it home. Suppose your home is a cell (0,0) on an infinite grid.You also have the sequence of instructions of this robot. It is written as the string s consisting of characters \'L\', \'R\', \'U\' and \'D\'. If the robot is in the cell (x,y) right now, he can move to one of the adjacent cells (depending on the current instruction).  If the current instruction is \'L\', then the robot can move to the left to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y);  if the current instruction is \'R\', then the robot can move to the right to (x+1,y);  if the current instruction is \'U\', then the robot can move to the top to (x,y+1);  if the current instruction is \'D\', then the robot can move to the bottom to (x,y\xe2\x88\x921). You\'ve noticed the warning on the last page of the manual: if the robot visits some cell (except (0,0)) twice then it breaks.So the sequence of instructions is valid if the robot starts in the cell (0,0), performs the given instructions, visits no cell other than (0,0) two or more times and ends the path in the cell (0,0). Also cell (0,0) should be visited at most two times: at the beginning and at the end (if the path is empty then it is visited only once). For example, the following sequences of instructions are considered valid: ""UD"", ""RL"", ""UUURULLDDDDLDDRRUU"", and the following are considered invalid: ""U"" (the endpoint is not (0,0)) and ""UUDD"" (the cell (0,1) is visited twice).The initial sequence of instructions, however, might be not valid. You don\'t want your robot to break so you decided to reprogram it in the following way: you will remove some (possibly, all or none) instructions from the initial sequence of instructions, then rearrange the remaining instructions as you wish and turn on your robot to move. Your task is to remove as few instructions from the initial sequence as possible and rearrange the remaining ones so that the sequence is valid. Report the valid sequence of the maximum length you can obtain.Note that you can choose any order of remaining instructions (you don\'t need to minimize the number of swaps or any other similar metric).You have to answer q independent test cases." 1200

All classes are held in different places according to the subject \xe2\x80\x94 maths classes are held in auditoriums, programming classes are held in computer labs, and P.

Analogically, the auditorium, lab and gym for the second subgroup can accept no more than ai,2, bi,2 and ci,2 students, respectively.As usual, some students skip some classes. Each student considers some number of subjects (from 0 to 3) to be useless \xe2\x80\x94 that means, he skips all classes on these subjects (and attends all other classes). This data is given to you as follows \xe2\x80\x94 the i-th group consists of:  di,1 students which attend all classes;  di,2 students which attend all classes, except for P.\xe2\x80\x89E.;  di,3 students which attend all classes, except for programming;  di,4 students which attend only maths classes;  di,5 students which attend all classes, except for maths;  di,6 students which attend only programming classes;  di,7 students which attend only P.\xe2\x80\x89E. There is one more type of students \xe2\x80\x94 those who don\'t attend any classes at all (but they, obviously, don\'t need any place in auditoriums, labs or gyms, so the number of those students is insignificant in this problem).Your task is to divide each group into two subgroups so that every auditorium (or lab, or gym) assigned to each subgroup has enough place for all students from this subgroup attending the corresponding classes (if it is possible).

Furthermore, after capturing a castle (or later) you can defend it: if you leave at least one warrior in a castle, this castle is considered defended. Each castle has an importance parameter ci, and your total score is the sum of importance values over all defended castles. There are two ways to defend a castle:  if you are currently in the castle i, you may leave one warrior to defend castle i;  there are m one-way portals connecting the castles. Each portal is characterised by two numbers of castles u and v (for each portal holds u>v). A portal can be used as follows: if you are currently in the castle u, you may send one warrior to defend castle v. Obviously, when you order your warrior to defend some castle, he leaves your army.You capture the castles in fixed order: you have to capture the first one, then the second one, and so on. After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i+1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won\'t be available to you.If, during some moment in the game, you don\'t have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose. Your goal is to maximize the sum of importance values over all defended castles (note that you may hire new warriors in the last castle, defend it and use portals leading from it even after you capture it \xe2\x80\x94 your score will be calculated afterwards).Can you determine an optimal strategy of capturing and defending the castles?" 2100

The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values).

The game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn\'t see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn\'t have any cards.For example, suppose that n=5, the first player has cards with values 2 and 3, and the second player has cards with values 1, 4, 5. Then one possible flow of the game is:The first player chooses the card 3. The second player chooses the card 1. As 3>1, the first player gets both cards.

So, instead of storing a key, he decided to store a fingerprint of a key.

The fingerprint is defined as the multiset of the remainders of these divisions. For example, this is how Karl\'s fingerprint algorithm is applied to the key 11: 11 divided by 2 has remainder 1 and result 5, then 5 divided by 3 has remainder 2 and result 1, and 1 divided by 4 has remainder 1 and result 0. Thus, the key 11 produces the sequence of remainders [1,2,1] and has the fingerprint multiset {1,1,2}.Ksenia wants to prove that Karl\'s fingerprint algorithm is not very good. For example, she found that both keys 178800 and 123456 produce the fingerprint of {0,0,0,0,2,3,3,4}.

If she wants it to be deployed, it must be done even if the feature f fails the tests on the server s. If she does not want it to be deployed, you may not deploy it there.Your company has two important instruments for the deployment of new features to servers: Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Testing (CT). CD can be established between several pairs of servers, forming a directed graph. CT can be set up on some set of servers.If CD is configured from the server s1 to the server s2 then every time s1 receives a new feature f the system starts the following deployment process of f to s2:  If the feature f is already deployed on the server s2, then nothing is done.  Otherwise, if CT is not set up on the server s1, then the server s1 just deploys the feature f to the server s2 without any testing.  Otherwise, the server s1 runs tests for the feature f. If the tests fail on the server s1, nothing is done. If the tests pass, then the server s1 deploys the feature f to the server s2.

1267B "Balls of Buma" NA "Balph is learning to play a game called Buma. In this game, he is given a row of colored balls. He has to choose the color of one new ball and the place to insert it (between two balls, or to the left of all the balls, or to the right of all the balls).When the ball is inserted the following happens repeatedly: if some segment of balls of the same color became longer as a result of a previous action and its length became at least 3, then all the balls of this segment are eliminated. Consider, for example, a row of balls \'AAABBBWWBB\'. Suppose Balph chooses a ball of color \'W\' and the place to insert it after the sixth ball, i. e. to the left of the two \'W\'s. After Balph inserts this ball, the balls of color \'W\' are eliminated, since this segment was made longer and has length 3 now, so the row becomes \'AAABBBBB\'. The balls of color \'B\' are eliminated now, because the segment of balls of color \'B\' became longer and has length 5 now. Thus, the row becomes \'AAA\'. However, none of the balls are eliminated now, because there is no elongated segment.Help Balph count the number of possible ways to choose a color of a new ball and a place to insert it that leads to the elimination of all the balls." 900

In order to do this, he first needs to accumulate enough resources for the construction. There are n types of resources, numbered 1 through n. Bob needs at least ai pieces of the i-th resource to build the spaceship. The number ai is called the goal for resource i.Each resource takes 1 turn to produce and in each turn only one resource can be produced. However, there are certain milestones that speed up production. Every milestone is a triple (sj,tj,uj), meaning that as soon as Bob has tj units of the resource sj, he receives one unit of the resource uj for free, without him needing to spend a turn. It is possible that getting this free resource allows Bob to claim reward for another milestone. This way, he can obtain a large number of resources in a single turn.The game is constructed in such a way that there are never two milestones that have the same sj and tj, that is, the award for reaching tj units of resource sj is at most one additional resource.A bonus is never awarded for 0 of any resource, neither for reaching the goal ai nor for going past the goal \xe2\x80\x94 formally, for every milestone 0<tj<asj.A bonus for reaching certain amount of a resource can be the resource itself, that is, sj=uj.Initially there are no milestones.

Occasionally, a person might not have enough currency to buy what he wants or needs, so he borrows money from someone else, with the idea that he will repay the loan later with interest. Let d(a,b) denote the debt of a towards b, or 0 if there is no such debt.Sometimes, this becomes very complex, as the person lending money can run into financial troubles before his debtor is able to repay his debt, and finds himself in the need of borrowing money. When this process runs for a long enough time, it might happen that there are so many debts that they can be consolidated. There are two ways this can be done:  Let d(a,b)>0 and d(c,d)>0 such that a\xe2\x89\xa0c or b\xe2\x89\xa0d.

You need to implement an extra module for brackets coloring in text.Your editor consists of a line with infinite length and cursor, which points to the current character.

If the cursor is already at the first (leftmost) position, then it does not move left.Initially, the cursor is in the first (leftmost) character.Also, the user can write a letter or brackets (either (, or )) to the position that the cursor is currently pointing at. A new character always overwrites the old value at that position.Your editor must check, whether the current line is the correct text. Text is correct if the brackets in them form the correct bracket sequence.Formally, correct text (CT) must satisfy the following rules:   any line without brackets is CT (the line can contain whitespaces);  If the first character of the string \xe2\x80\x94 is (, the last \xe2\x80\x94 is ), and all the rest form a CT, then the whole line is a CT;  two consecutively written CT is also CT. Examples of correct texts: hello(codeforces), round, ((i)(write))edi(tor)s, ( me). Examples of incorrect texts: hello)oops(, round), ((me).The user uses special commands to work with your editor. Each command has its symbol, which must be written to execute this command.The correspondence of commands and characters is as follows:   L \xe2\x80\x94 move the cursor one character to the left (remains in place if it already points to the first character);  R \xe2\x80\x94 move the cursor one character to the right;  any lowercase Latin letter or bracket (( or )) \xe2\x80\x94 write the entered character to the position where the cursor is now. For a complete understanding, take a look at the first example and its illustrations in the note below.You are given a string containing the characters that the user entered. For the brackets coloring module\'s work, after each command you need to:  check if the current text in the editor is a correct text;  if it is, print the least number of colors that required, to color all brackets. If two pairs of brackets are nested (the first in the second or vice versa), then these pairs of brackets should be painted in different colors. If two pairs of brackets are not nested, then they can be painted in different or the same colors. For example, for the bracket sequence ()(())()() the least number of colors is 2, and for the bracket sequence (()(()())())(()) \xe2\x80\x94 is 3.Write a program that prints the minimal number of colors after processing each command." 2100

In other words, if:  admin\'s password is ""b"", then you can access to system by using any of this passwords: ""a"", ""b"", ""ab"";  admin\'s password is ""d"", then you can access to system by using only ""d"". Only one password from the list is the admin\'s password from the testing system. Help hacker to calculate the minimal number of passwords, required to guaranteed access to the system.

It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed n.You are standing at 0 and want to reach n+1 somehow. If you are standing at the position x, you can jump to any position in the range [x+1;x+d]. However you don\'t really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if d=1, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells 0 and n+1 belong to wooden platforms.You want to know if it is possible to reach n+1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.Note that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).For example, if n=7, m=3, d=2 and c=[1,2,1], then one of the ways to reach 8 from 0 is follow:  The first example: n=7." 1700

After the final, he compared the prediction with the actual result and found out that the i-th team according to his prediction ended up at the pi-th position (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n, all pi are unique). In other words, p is a permutation of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n.As Bob\'s favorite League player is the famous ""3ga"", he decided to write down every 3 consecutive elements of the permutation p. Formally, Bob created an array q of n\xe2\x88\x922 triples, where qi=(pi,pi+1,pi+2) for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x922. Bob was very proud of his array, so he showed it to his friend Alice.After learning of Bob\'s array, Alice declared that she could retrieve the permutation p even if Bob rearranges the elements of q and the elements within each triple. Of course, Bob did not believe in such magic, so he did just the same as above to see Alice\'s respond.For example, if n=5 and p=[1,4,2,3,5], then the original array q will be [(1,4,2),(4,2,3),(2,3,5)]. Bob can then rearrange the numbers within each triple and the positions of the triples to get [(4,3,2),(2,3,5),(4,1,2)]. Note that [(1,4,2),(4,2,2),(3,3,5)] is not a valid rearrangement of q, as Bob is not allowed to swap numbers belong to different triples.As Alice\'s friend, you know for sure that Alice was just trying to show off, so you decided to save her some face by giving her any permutation p that is consistent with the array q she was given." 1600

To make a steel chain connecting fridges u and v, you have to pay au+av dollars. Note that the landlord allows you to create multiple chains connecting the same pair of fridges. Hanh\'s apartment landlord asks you to create exactly m steel chains so that all fridges are private. A fridge is private if and only if, among n people living in the apartment, only the owner can open it (i.e. no other person acting alone can do it). In other words, the fridge i is not private if there exists the person j (i\xe2\x89\xa0j) that the person j can open the fridge i.For example, in the picture all the fridges are private. On the other hand, if there are n=2 fridges and only one chain (which connects them) then both fridges are not private (both fridges can be open not only by its owner but also by another person).Of course, the landlord wants to minimize the total cost of all steel chains to fulfill his request.

As chocolate boxes are lame, he decided to decorate a tree instead. Bob\'s tree can be represented as an undirected connected graph with n nodes (numbered 1 to n) and n\xe2\x88\x921 edges. Initially, Bob placed a decoration with label i on node i, for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n. However, as such a simple arrangement is lame, he decided to shuffle the decorations a bit. Formally, Bob did the following steps: First, he listed the n\xe2\x88\x921 edges in some order. Then, he considered the edges one by one in that order. For each edge (u,v), he swapped the decorations of node u with the one of node v.After finishing, Bob seemed satisfied with the arrangement, so he went to sleep.The next morning, Bob wakes up only to find out that his beautiful arrangement has been ruined! Last night, Bob\'s younger brother Bobo dropped some of the decorations on the floor while he was playing with the tree. Fortunately, no decorations were lost, so Bob can repair the tree in no time. However, he completely forgets how the tree looked like yesterday. Therefore, given the labels of the decorations still on the tree, Bob wants to know the number of possible configurations of the tree. As the result can be quite large, Bob will be happy if you can output the result modulo 1000000007 (109+7). Note that, it is possible that there exists no possible configurations." 3300

1252F "Regular Forestation" hashing,trees "A forestation is an act of planting a bunch of trees to grow a forest, usually to replace a forest that had been cut down. Strangely enough, graph theorists have another idea on how to make a forest, i.e. by cutting down a tree!A tree is a graph of N nodes connected by N\xe2\x88\x921 edges. Let u be a node in a tree U which degree is at least 2 (i.e. directly connected to at least 2 other nodes in U). If we remove u from U, then we will get two or more disconnected (smaller) trees, or also known as forest by graph theorists. In this problem, we are going to investigate a special forestation of a tree done by graph theorists.Let V(S) be the set of nodes in a tree S and V(T) be the set of nodes in a tree T. Tree S and tree T are identical if there exists a bijection f:V(S)\xe2\x86\x92V(T) such that for all pairs of nodes (si,sj) in V(S), si and sj is connected by an edge in S if and only if node f(si) and f(sj) is connected by an edge in T. Note that f(s)=t implies node s in S corresponds to node t in T.We call a node u in a tree U as a good cutting point if and only if the removal of u from U causes two or more disconnected trees, and all those disconnected trees are pairwise identical.Given a tree U, your task is to determine whether there exists a good cutting point in U. If there is such a node, then you should output the maximum number of disconnected trees that can be obtained by removing exactly one good cutting point.For example, consider the following tree of 13 nodes.There is exactly one good cutting point in this tree, i.e. node 4. Observe that by removing node 4, we will get three identical trees (in this case, line graphs), i.e. {5,1,7,13}, {8,2,11,6}, and {3,12,9,10}, which are denoted by A, B, and C respectively in the figure.

The diagonal arrow up in the figure implies that Ai<Ai+1, the straight right arrow implies that Ai=Ai+1, and the diagonal arrow down implies that Ai>Ai+1.  Supposed we want to make a new melody with L=1, R=8, and K=6. The new melody B={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8} as shown in the figure satisfies all the requirements, and it is the lexicographically smallest possible." 2200

1252C "Even Path" "data structures,implementation" "Pathfinding is a task of finding a route between two points. It often appears in many problems. For example, in a GPS navigation software where a driver can query for a suggested route, or in a robot motion planning where it should find a valid sequence of movements to do some tasks, or in a simple maze solver where it should find a valid path from one point to another point. This problem is related to solving a maze.The maze considered in this problem is in the form of a matrix of integers A of N\xc3\x97N. The value of each cell is generated from a given array R and C of N integers each. Specifically, the value on the ith row and jth column, cell (i,j), is equal to Ri+Cj. Note that all indexes in this problem are from 1 to N.A path in this maze is defined as a sequence of cells (r1,c1),(r2,c2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(rk,ck) such that |ri\xe2\x88\x92ri+1|+|ci\xe2\x88\x92ci+1|=1 for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<k. In other words, each adjacent cell differs only by 1 row or only by 1 column. An even path in this maze is defined as a path in which all the cells in the path contain only even numbers.Given a tuple \xe2\x9f\xa8ra,ca,rb,cb\xe2\x9f\xa9 as a query, your task is to determine whether there exists an even path from cell (ra,ca) to cell (rb,cb). To simplify the problem, it is guaranteed that both cell (ra,ca) and cell (rb,cb) contain even numbers.For example, let N=5, R={6,2,7,8,3}, and C={3,4,8,5,1}. The following figure depicts the matrix A of 5\xc3\x975 which is generated from the given array R and C.  Let us consider several queries:   \xe2\x9f\xa82,2,1,3\xe2\x9f\xa9: There is an even path from cell (2,2) to cell (1,3), e.g., (2,2),(2,3),(1,3). Of course, (2,2),(1,2),(1,3) is also a valid even path.  \xe2\x9f\xa84,2,4,3\xe2\x9f\xa9: There is an even path from cell (4,2) to cell (4,3), namely (4,2),(4,3).  \xe2\x9f\xa85,1,3,4\xe2\x9f\xa9: There is no even path from cell (5,1) to cell (3,4). Observe that the only two neighboring cells of (5,1) are cell (5,2) and cell (4,1), and both of them contain odd numbers (7 and 11, respectively), thus, there cannot be any even path originating from cell (5,1)." 1600
1252B "Cleaning Robots" dp,trees "The new ICPC town has N junctions (numbered from 1 to N) which are connected by N\xe2\x88\x921 roads. It is possible from one junction to go to any other junctions by going through one or more roads. To make sure all the junctions are well-maintained, the government environment agency is planning to deploy their newest advanced cleaning robots. In addition to its cleaning ability, each robot is also equipped with a movement ability such that it can move from one junction to any other junctions connected by roads. However, as you might have guessed, such robots are not cheap. Therefore, the agency is considering the following deployment plan.Let Tk be the set of junctions which should be cleaned by the kth robot (also known as, the robot\'s task), and |Tk|\xe2\x89\xa51 be the number of junctions in Tk. The junctions in Tk form a path, i.e. there exists a sequence of v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,v|Tk| where vi\xe2\x88\x88Tk and vi\xe2\x89\xa0vj for all i\xe2\x89\xa0j such that each adjacent junction in this sequence is connected by a road. The union of T for all robots is equal to the set of all junctions in ICPC town. On the other hand, no two robots share a common junction, i.e. Ti\xe2\x88\xa9Tj=\xe2\x88\x85 if i\xe2\x89\xa0j.To avoid complaints from citizens for an inefficient operation, the deployment plan should be irreducible; in other words, there should be no two robots, i and j, such that Ti\xe2\x88\xaaTj forms a (longer) path. Note that the agency does not care whether the number of robots being used is minimized as long as all the tasks are irreducible.Your task in this problem is to count the number of feasible deployment plan given the town\'s layout. A plan is feasible if and only if it satisfies all the above-mentioned requirements.For example, let N=6 and the roads are {(1,3),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(4,6)}. There are 5 feasible deployment plans as shown in the following figure.   The first plan uses 2 robots (labeled as A and B in the figure) to clean {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}.  The second plan uses 3 robots (labeled as A, B, and C in the figure) to clean {1,3,4,6}, {2}, and {5}.  The third plan uses 3 robots to clean {1,3,4,5}, {2}, and {6}.  The fourth plan uses 3 robots to clean {1}, {2,3,4,6}, and {5}.  The fifth plan uses 3 robots to clean {1}, {2,3,4,5}, and {6}.  No other plans are feasible in this case. For example, the plan {{1,3},{2},{4,5,6}} is not feasible as the task {1,3} and {2} can be combined into a longer path {1,3,2}. The plan {{1,2,3,4},{5},{6}} is also not feasible as {1,2,3,4} is not a path." 2300

Darto wants to copy Danang\'s homework, but Danang asks Darto to change it up a bit so it does not look obvious that Darto copied.The difference of two permutations of N integers A and B, denoted by diff(A,B), is the sum of the absolute difference of Ai and Bi for all i. In other words, diff(A,B)=\xce\xa3Ni=1|Ai\xe2\x88\x92Bi|. Darto would like to create a permutation of N integers that maximizes its difference with A.

Since the teacher giving the homework is lenient, any permutation of N integers B is considered different with A if the difference of A and B is at least N. Therefore, you are allowed to return any permutation of N integers B such that diff(A,B)\xe2\x89\xa5N.Of course, you can still return Bmax if you want, since it can be proven that diff(A,Bmax)\xe2\x89\xa5N for any permutation A and N>1. This also proves that there exists a solution for any permutation of N integers A. If there is more than one valid solution, you can output any of them." 1000

To check which buttons need replacement, Polycarp pressed some buttons in sequence, and a string s appeared on the screen. When Polycarp presses a button with character c, one of the following events happened:  if the button was working correctly, a character c appeared at the end of the string Polycarp was typing;  if the button was malfunctioning, two characters c appeared at the end of the string. For example, suppose the buttons corresponding to characters a and c are working correctly, and the button corresponding to b is malfunctioning.

Also there are n wires numbered from 1 to n, each connecting two distinct contact points on the board. An electric signal can pass between wires A and B if:   either both wires share the same contact point;  or there is a sequence of wires starting with A and ending with B, and each pair of adjacent wires in the sequence share a contact point.   The picture shows a circuit board with 5 wires. Contact points with numbers 2,5,7,8,10,13 are used. Here an electrical signal can pass from wire 2 to wire 3, but not to wire 1. Currently the circuit board is broken. Polycarpus thinks that the board could be fixed if the wires were re-soldered so that a signal could pass between any pair of wires.It takes 1 minute for Polycarpus to re-solder an end of a wire. I.e. it takes one minute to change one of the two contact points for a wire. Any contact point from range [1,109] can be used as a new contact point. A wire\'s ends must always be soldered to distinct contact points. Both wire\'s ends can be re-solded, but that will require two actions and will take 2 minutes in total.Find the minimum amount of time Polycarpus needs to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires.

Each cell of the garden contains either a plant or a slab. It\'s known that slabs are located on the main diagonal of the matrix representing the garden, and in the cells that are below the main diagonal and share a side with at least one cell of the main diagonal. All the remaining cells of the garden are filled with plants.  Example of the garden for n=5. During implementation of the project you created a smart robot that takes a list of commands as an input, which are processed one by one. Each command contains:   a list of horizontal lines (rows in the matrix representing the garden);  a list of vertical lines (columns in the matrix representing the garden). While executing each command robot waters only cells in the intersection of specified rows and specified columns. So, if you specify r rows and c columns, then exactly r\xe2\x8b\x85c cells will be watered.In the demo for the customer you have tuned robot in such a way that it waters all the garden. To do that you prepared a single command containing all n rows and all n columns.Unfortunately, 5 hours before the demo for your customer it turned out that the CEO of Berland Gardeners United Inc. was going to take part in it. Moreover, most probably he will be standing on a garden slab during the demo!Now you need to create a list of commands for the robot so that it waters all the plants and doesn\'t water any cell containing a slab. Since it\'s only a beta version of ""SmartGarden"", the total number of commands shouldn\'t exceed 50.Create a program that, for a given size of the garden, will find a list of no more than 50 commands that allow the robot to water all the plants in the garden without watering the slabs.

For this reason, each concert will be performed by a different set of dancers. A dancer may perform in multiple concerts. For example, it is possible that a set of dancers performs in one concert and a subset of this set of dancers performs in another concert.

1250E "The Coronation" graphs,implementation "The coronation of King Berl XXII is soon! The whole royal family, including n daughters of Berl XXII, will be present.The King has ordered his jeweler to assemble n beautiful necklaces, so each of the princesses could wear exactly one necklace during the ceremony \xe2\x80\x94 and now these necklaces are finished. Each necklace consists of m gems attached to a gold chain. There are two types of gems used in the necklaces \xe2\x80\x94 emeralds and sapphires. So, each necklace can be represented by a sequence of m gems (listed from left to right), and each gem is either an emerald or a sapphire. Formally, the i-th necklace can be represented by a binary string si of length m; if the j-th character of si is 0, then the j-th gem in the i-th necklace is an emerald; otherwise, this gem is a sapphire.Now, looking at the necklaces, the King is afraid that some of his daughters may envy the other daughters\' necklaces. He wants all necklaces to look similar. Two necklaces are considered similar if there are at least k positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems.For example, if there is a necklace represented by a sequence 01010111 and a necklace represented by a sequence 01100000, then there are 3 positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems (both first gems are emeralds, both second gems are sapphires, and both fifth gems are emeralds). So if k=3, these necklaces are similar, and if k=4, they are not similar.The King thinks that if two of his daughters notice that their necklaces are not similar, then they may have a conflict \xe2\x80\x94 and, obviously, he doesn\'t want any conflicts during the coronation! So Berl XXII wants to tell some of his daughters to wear their necklaces backward. If a necklace is worn backward, then the sequence of gems in this necklace is reversed. For example, if a necklace is represented by a sequence 01100, then, if worn backward, it would be represented by a sequence 00110. The King wants to find the minimum number of necklaces to be worn backward during the coronation so that there are no conflicts.Berl XXII is too busy with preparation for the coronation, so he ordered you to resolve this issue for him. Help him \xe2\x80\x94 and he will give you a truly royal reward!" 2300

She spent six months in that temple just playing ""Cat\'s Cradle"" so now she wants to try a different game \xe2\x80\x94 ""Snakes and Ladders"". Unfortunately, she already killed all the snakes, so there are only ladders left now. The game is played on a 10\xc3\x9710 board as follows:  At the beginning of the game, the player is at the bottom left square.  The objective of the game is for the player to reach the Goal (the top left square) by following the path and climbing vertical ladders. Once the player reaches the Goal, the game ends.  The path is as follows: if a square is not the end of its row, it leads to the square next to it along the direction of its row; if a square is the end of its row, it leads to the square above it. The direction of a row is determined as follows: the direction of the bottom row is to the right; the direction of any other row is opposite the direction of the row below it. See Notes section for visualization of path.  During each turn, the player rolls a standard six-sided dice. Suppose that the number shown on the dice is r. If the Goal is less than r squares away on the path, the player doesn\'t move (but the turn is performed). Otherwise, the player advances exactly r squares along the path and then stops. If the player stops on a square with the bottom of a ladder, the player chooses whether or not to climb up that ladder. If she chooses not to climb, then she stays in that square for the beginning of the next turn.  Some squares have a ladder in them. Ladders are only placed vertically \xe2\x80\x94 each one leads to the same square of some of the upper rows. In order for the player to climb up a ladder, after rolling the dice, she must stop at the square containing the bottom of the ladder. After using the ladder, the player will end up in the square containing the top of the ladder. She cannot leave the ladder in the middle of climbing. And if the square containing the top of the ladder also contains the bottom of another ladder, she is not allowed to use that second ladder.  The numbers on the faces of the dice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with each number having the same probability of being shown. Please note that:     it is possible for ladders to overlap, but the player cannot switch to the other ladder while in the middle of climbing the first one;     it is possible for ladders to go straight to the top row, but not any higher;     it is possible for two ladders to lead to the same tile;     it is possible for a ladder to lead to a tile that also has a ladder, but the player will not be able to use that second ladder if she uses the first one;     the player can only climb up ladders, not climb down.

1245A "Good ol\' Numbers Coloring" "math,number theory" "Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: 0,1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6. Given two integers a and b (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4104). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint 0, then we paint 1, then 2 and so on.Each number is painted white or black. We paint a number i according to the following rules:   if i=0, it is colored white;   if i\xe2\x89\xa5a and i\xe2\x88\x92a is colored white, i is also colored white;   if i\xe2\x89\xa5b and i\xe2\x88\x92b is colored white, i is also colored white;   if i is still not colored white, it is colored black. In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors.For example, if a=3, b=5, then the colors of the numbers (in the order from 0) are: white (0), black (1), black (2), white (3), black (4), white (5), white (6), black (7), white (8), white (9), ...Note that:   It is possible that there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For example, if a=10 and b=10, then only 0,10,20,30 and any other nonnegative integers that end in 0 when written in base 10 are white. The other integers are colored black.   It is also possible that there are only finitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For example, when a=1 and b=10, then there is no nonnegative integer colored black at all. Your task is to determine whether or not the number of nonnegative integers colored black is infinite.If there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black, simply print a line containing ""Infinite"" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print ""Finite"" (without the quotes)." 1000

Note, that the moves don\'t change the length of the string s. You can apply a move only to the string s.For example, if s=""test"" in one move you can obtain:  if i=1 and you move to the beginning, then the result is ""test"" (the string doesn\'t change),  if i=2 and you move to the beginning, then the result is ""etst"",  if i=3 and you move to the beginning, then the result is ""stet"",  if i=4 and you move to the beginning, then the result is ""ttes"",  if i=1 and you move to the end, then the result is ""estt"",  if i=2 and you move to the end, then the result is ""tste"",  if i=3 and you move to the end, then the result is ""tets"",  if i=4 and you move to the end, then the result is ""test"" (the string doesn\'t change).

For example, [2;5] and [3;10] have a common point, but [5;6] and [1;4] don\'t have.You should add one segment, which has at least one common point with each of the given segments and as short as possible (i.e. has minimal length). The required segment can degenerate to be a point (i.e a segment with length zero).

You have been tasked with optimizing the production of a certain type of tree for an especially large and important order.The tree in question is a rooted tree with n vertices labelled with distinct integers from 0 to n\xe2\x88\x921. The vertex labelled 0 is the root of the tree, and for any non-root vertex v the label of its parent p(v) is less than the label of v.All trees at the factory are made from bamboo blanks. A bamboo is a rooted tree such that each vertex has exactly one child, except for a single leaf vertex with no children. The vertices of a bamboo blank can be labelled arbitrarily before its processing is started.To process a bamboo into another tree a single type of operation can be made: choose an arbitrary non-root vertex v such that its parent p(v) is not a root either. The operation consists of changing the parent of v to its parent\'s parent p(p(v)). Note that parents of all other vertices remain unchanged, in particular, the subtree of v does not change.Efficiency is crucial, hence you have to minimize the number of operations to make the desired tree from a bamboo blank. Construct any optimal sequence of operations to produce the desired tree.Note that the labelling of the resulting tree has to coincide with the labelling of the desired tree. Formally, the labels of the roots have to be equal, and for non-root vertices with the same label the labels of their parents should be the same.It is guaranteed that for any test present in this problem an answer exists, and further, an optimal sequence contains at most 106 operations.

They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what\'s the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 20+21+22.And if p=\xe2\x88\x929 we can represent 7 as one number (24\xe2\x88\x929).Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example)." 1600

Then the player changes l and r in this way: l:=l\xe2\x80\xb2, r:=r\xe2\x80\xb2. Ann moves first. The player, that can\'t make a move loses.Recall that a substring s[l,r] (l\xe2\x89\xa4r) of a string s is a continuous segment of letters from s that starts at position l and ends at position r. For example, ""ehn"" is a substring (s[3,5]) of ""aaaehnsvz"" and ""ahz"" is not.Mike and Ann were playing so enthusiastically that they did not notice the teacher approached them. Surprisingly, the teacher didn\'t scold them, instead of that he said, that he can figure out the winner of the game before it starts, even if he knows only s and k.Unfortunately, Mike and Ann are not so keen in the game theory, so they ask you to write a program, that takes s and determines the winner for all possible k." 1300

A new radio tower has been installed in Bertown, it can transmit a signal with any integer power from 1 to M (let\'s denote the signal power as f). The mayor has decided that he will choose a set of radio stations and establish a contract with every chosen station. To establish a contract with the i-th station, the following conditions should be met:  the signal power f should be not less than li, otherwise the signal of the i-th station won\'t cover the whole city;  the signal power f should be not greater than ri, otherwise the signal will be received by the residents of other towns which haven\'t established a contract with the i-th station. All this information was already enough for the mayor to realise that choosing the stations is hard. But after consulting with specialists, he learned that some stations the signals of some stations may interfere with each other: there are m pairs of stations (ui, vi) that use the same signal frequencies, and for each such pair it is impossible to establish contracts with both stations. If stations x and y use the same frequencies, and y and z use the same frequencies, it does not imply that x and z use the same frequencies.The mayor finds it really hard to analyze this situation, so he hired you to help him.

A ticket is considered happy if the sum of the first n2 digits of this ticket is equal to the sum of the last n2 digits.Monocarp and Bicarp take turns (and Monocarp performs the first of them). During each turn, the current player must replace any erased digit with any digit from 0 to 9. The game ends when there are no erased digits in the ticket.If the ticket is happy after all erased digits are replaced with decimal digits, then Bicarp wins. Otherwise, Monocarp wins.

There are n disjoint walkways in between. The i-th walkway is described by two integers xi and yi and a real value si. The i-th walkway starts at xi, ends at yi and has speed si. Every walkway is located inside the segment [0,L] and no two walkways have positive intersection. However, they can touch by endpoints.Limak needs to decide how to distribute his energy. For example, it might make more sense to stand somewhere (or to walk slowly) to then have a lot of energy to walk faster.Limak\'s initial energy is 0 and it must never drop below that value. At any moment, he can walk with any speed v in the interval [0,2] and it will cost him v energy per second, but he continuously recovers energy with speed of 1 energy per second. So, when he walks with speed v, his energy increases by (1\xe2\x88\x92v). Note that negative value would mean losing energy.In particular, he can walk with speed 1 and this won\'t change his energy at all, while walking with speed 0.77 effectively gives him 0.23 energy per second.Limak can choose his speed arbitrarily (any real value in interval [0,2]) at every moment of time (including the moments when he is located on non-integer positions).

1207D "Number Of Permutations" combinatorics "You are given a sequence of n pairs of integers: (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(an,bn). This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in non-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending order by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples of good and bad sequences:  s=[(1,2),(3,2),(3,1)] is bad because the sequence of first elements is sorted: [1,3,3];  s=[(1,2),(3,2),(1,2)] is bad because the sequence of second elements is sorted: [2,2,2];  s=[(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)] is bad because both sequences (the sequence of first elements and the sequence of second elements) are sorted;  s=[(1,3),(3,3),(2,2)] is good because neither the sequence of first elements ([1,3,2]) nor the sequence of second elements ([3,3,2]) is sorted. Calculate the number of permutations of size n such that after applying this permutation to the sequence s it turns into a good sequence. A permutation p of size n is a sequence p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n). If you apply permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn to the sequence s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn you get the sequence sp1,sp2,\xe2\x80\xa6,spn.

1207C "Gas Pipeline" dp,greedy "You are responsible for installing a gas pipeline along a road. Let\'s consider the road (for simplicity) as a segment [0,n] on OX axis. The road can have several crossroads, but for simplicity, we\'ll denote each crossroad as an interval (x,x+1) with integer x. So we can represent the road as a binary string consisting of n characters, where character 0 means that current interval doesn\'t contain a crossroad, and 1 means that there is a crossroad.Usually, we can install the pipeline along the road on height of 1 unit with supporting pillars in each integer point (so, if we are responsible for [0,n] road, we must install n+1 pillars). But on crossroads we should lift the pipeline up to the height 2, so the pipeline won\'t obstruct the way for cars.We can do so inserting several zig-zag-like lines. Each zig-zag can be represented as a segment [x,x+1] with integer x consisting of three parts: 0.5 units of horizontal pipe + 1 unit of vertical pipe + 0.5 of horizontal. Note that if pipeline is currently on height 2, the pillars that support it should also have length equal to 2 units.  Each unit of gas pipeline costs us a bourles, and each unit of pillar \xe2\x80\x94 b bourles. So, it\'s not always optimal to make the whole pipeline on the height 2. Find the shape of the pipeline with minimum possible cost and calculate that cost.Note that you must start and finish the pipeline on height 1 and, also, it\'s guaranteed that the first and last characters of the input string are equal to 0." 1500

1202B "You Are Given a Decimal String..." "brute force,dp,shortest paths" "Suppose you have a special x-y-counter. This counter can store some value as a decimal number; at first, the counter has value 0. The counter performs the following algorithm: it prints its lowest digit and, after that, adds either x or y to its value. So all sequences this counter generates are starting from 0. For example, a 4-2-counter can act as follows:  it prints 0, and adds 4 to its value, so the current value is 4, and the output is 0;  it prints 4, and adds 4 to its value, so the current value is 8, and the output is 04;  it prints 8, and adds 4 to its value, so the current value is 12, and the output is 048;  it prints 2, and adds 2 to its value, so the current value is 14, and the output is 0482;  it prints 4, and adds 4 to its value, so the current value is 18, and the output is 04824. This is only one of the possible outputs; for example, the same counter could generate 0246802468024 as the output, if we chose to add 2 during each step.You wrote down a printed sequence from one of such x-y-counters. But the sequence was corrupted and several elements from the sequence could be erased.Now you\'d like to recover data you\'ve lost, but you don\'t even know the type of the counter you used.

In Graph Traveler, there is a directed graph consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. The i-th vertex has mi outgoing edges that are labeled as ei[0], ei[1], \xe2\x80\xa6, ei[mi\xe2\x88\x921], each representing the destination vertex of the edge. The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The i-th vertex also has an integer ki written on itself.A travel on this graph works as follows.   Gildong chooses a vertex to start from, and an integer to start with. Set the variable c to this integer.  After arriving at the vertex i, or when Gildong begins the travel at some vertex i, add ki to c.  The next vertex is ei[x] where x is an integer 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x88\x921 satisfying x\xe2\x89\xa1c(modmi). Go to the next vertex and go back to step 2. It\'s obvious that a travel never ends, since the 2nd and the 3rd step will be repeated endlessly.For example, assume that Gildong starts at vertex 1 with c=5, and m1=2, e1[0]=1, e1[1]=2, k1=\xe2\x88\x923. Right after he starts at vertex 1, c becomes 2. Since the only integer x (0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41) where x\xe2\x89\xa1c(modmi) is 0, Gildong goes to vertex e1[0]=1. After arriving at vertex 1 again, c becomes \xe2\x88\x921. The only integer x satisfying the conditions is 1, so he goes to vertex e1[1]=2, and so on.Since Gildong is quite inquisitive, he\'s going to ask you q queries. He wants to know how many distinct vertices will be visited infinitely many times, if he starts the travel from a certain vertex with a certain value of c.

Furthermore, you may send exactly one command to all of the robots.

The robot stops its movement in two cases:  either it reaches (X, Y);  or it cannot get any closer to (X, Y). Normally, all robots should be able to get from any point of the coordinate plane to any other point. Each robot usually can perform four actions to move.

So, it takes him either ti seconds or ti+1 seconds to solve the i-th crossword, equiprobably (with probability 12 he solves the crossword in exactly ti seconds, and with probability 12 he has to spend an additional second to finish the crossword). All these events are independent.After T seconds pass (or after solving the last crossword, if he manages to do it in less than T seconds), Adilbek closes the app (if he finishes some crossword at the same moment, that crossword is considered solved; otherwise Adilbek does not finish solving the current crossword at all). He thinks it would be an interesting probability theory problem to calculate E \xe2\x80\x94 the expected number of crosswords he will be able to solve completely. Can you calculate it? Recall that the expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values \xe2\x80\x94 in this problem it means that the expected value of the number of solved crosswords can be calculated as E=n\xe2\x88\x91i=0ipi, where pi is the probability that Adilbek will solve exactly i crosswords. We can represent E as rational fraction PQ with Q>0. To give the answer, you should print P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7)." 2400

1193C "Scissors and Tape" "*special problem,constructive algorithms,geometry" "You are given a piece of paper in the shape of a simple polygon S. Your task is to turn it into a simple polygon T that has the same area as S.You can use two tools: scissors and tape. Scissors can be used to cut any polygon into smaller polygonal pieces. Tape can be used to combine smaller pieces into larger polygons. You can use each tool multiple times, in any order. The polygons given in the input have integer coordinates, but you are allowed to produce shapes with non-integer coordinates in your output.A formal definition of the task follows.A shape Q=(Q0,\xe2\x80\xa6,Qn\xe2\x88\x921) is a sequence of three or more points in the plane such that:   The closed polyline Q0Q1Q2\xe2\x80\xa6Qn\xe2\x88\x921Q0 never touches or intersects itself, and therefore it forms the boundary of a simple polygon.  The polyline goes around the boundary of the polygon in the counter-clockwise direction. The polygon whose boundary is the shape Q will be denoted P(Q).Two shapes are called equivalent if one can be translated and/or rotated to become identical with the other.Note that mirroring a shape is not allowed. Also note that the order of points matters: the shape (Q1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Qn\xe2\x88\x921,Q0) is not necessarily equivalent to the shape (Q0,\xe2\x80\xa6,Qn\xe2\x88\x921).In the figure on the left: Shapes U and V are equivalent. Shape W is not equivalent with them because the points of W are given in a different order. Regardless of the order of points, the fourth shape is not equivalent with the previous ones either as flipping a shape is not allowed.In both input and output, a shape with n points is represented as a single line that contains 2n+1 space-separated numbers: the number n followed by the coordinates of the points: Q0,x, Q0,y, Q1,x, ...Shapes have identification numbers (IDs). The given shape S has ID 0, the shapes you produce in your solutions are given IDs 1, 2, 3, ..., in the order in which they are produced.Shapes B1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bk form a subdivision of shape A if:   The union of all P(Bi) is exactly P(A).  For each i\xe2\x89\xa0j, the area of the intersection of P(Bi) and P(Bj) is zero. The scissors operation destroys one existing shape A and produces one or more shapes B1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bk that form a subdivision of A.In the figure: Shape A (square) subdivided into shapes B1, B2, B3 (the three triangles). One valid way to describe one of the Bi is ""3 3 1 6 1 5.1 4"".The tape operation destroys one or more existing shapes A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ak and produces one new shape B. In order to perform this operation, you must first specify shapes C1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ck and only then the final shape B. These shapes must satisfy the following:   For each i, the shape Ci is equivalent to the shape Ai.  The shapes C1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ck form a subdivision of the shape B. Informally, you choose the shape B and show how to move each of the existing Ai to its correct location Ci within B. Note that only the shape B gets a new ID, the shapes Ci do not." -999

However, him being a businessman, he casually envisioned the impossible: among other things, he projected a slide coming from the Haunted Castle to the Roller Coaster, another from the Roller Coaster to the Drop Tower, and a third from the Drop Tower to the Haunted Castle. As the slides can only go downhill, it is evident why this is a problem. You don\'t have the luxury of ignoring the laws of physics when building the park, so you have to request changes in the project. Maybe he would accept reversing the slide between the Drop Tower and the Haunted Castle?Formally:   The project is a list of attractions and a list of directed slides. Each slide starts at one attraction and ends at another attraction.  A proposal is obtained from the project by reversing the directions of some slides (possibly none or all of them).  A proposal is legal if there is a way to assign an elevation to each attraction in such a way that every slide goes downhill.  The cost of a proposal is the number of slides whose directions were reversed. For a given project, find and report the sum of costs all legal proposals.

Then, you discard all unit cubes that do not touch the edges of the big cube. The figure below shows the object you will get for a=6.  Finally, you assign a letter to each of the unit cubes in the object. You must get a meaningful word along each edge of the big cube. Each edge can be read in either direction, and it is sufficient if one of the two directions of reading gives a meaningful word.The figure below shows the object for a=6 in which some unit cubes already have assigned letters. You can already read the words \'SUBMIT\', \'ACCEPT\' and \'TURING\' along three edges of the big cube.  You are given a list of valid words. Each word from the wordlist may appear on arbitrarily many edges of a valid cubeword.

The finished city will consist of n skyscrapers, each occupying a different cell of the grid. At any moment during the construction, the cells that currently do not contain a skyscraper are called empty.You are given the planned coordinates of the n skyscrapers. Your task is to find an order in which they can be built while satisfying the rules listed below.  The building crew has only one crane, so the Metropolis has to be constructed one skyscraper at a time.  The first skyscraper can be built anywhere on the grid.  Each subsequent skyscraper has to share a side or a corner with at least one of the previously built skyscrapers (so that it\'s easier to align the new skyscraper to the grid properly).  When building a skyscraper, there has to be a way to deliver material to the construction site from the outside of Metropolis by only moving it through empty cells that share a side. In other words, there should be a path of side-adjacent empty cells that connects the cell that will contain the skyscraper to some cell (r,c) with |r|>109 and/or |c|>109. If a solution exists, let\'s denote the numbers of skyscrapers in the order in which they should be built by s1,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn.

In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, \xe2\x80\xa6, 9m, 1p, 2p, \xe2\x80\xa6, 9p, 1s, 2s, \xe2\x80\xa6, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] \xe2\x80\x94 it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] \xe2\x80\x94 it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] \xe2\x80\x94 it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu.

Supposing that both players play optimally, who will win the game?Consider an example: n=3 and sizes of piles are a1=2, a2=3, a3=0. It is impossible to choose the empty pile, so Tokitsukaze has two choices: the first and the second piles. If she chooses the first pile then the state will be [1,3,0] and it is a good move. But if she chooses the second pile then the state will be [2,2,0] and she immediately loses. So the only good move for her is to choose the first pile. Supposing that both players always take their best moves and never make mistakes, who will win the game?Note that even if there are two piles with the same number of stones at the beginning, Tokitsukaze may still be able to make a valid first move.

However, she thought there were too many items, so now she wants to discard m (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n) special items of them.These n items are marked with indices from 1 to n. In the beginning, the item with index i is placed on the i-th position. Items are divided into several pages orderly, such that each page contains exactly k positions and the last positions on the last page may be left empty.Tokitsukaze would do the following operation: focus on the first special page that contains at least one special item, and at one time, Tokitsukaze would discard all special items on this page. After an item is discarded or moved, its old position would be empty, and then the item below it, if exists, would move up to this empty position. The movement may bring many items forward and even into previous pages, so Tokitsukaze would keep waiting until all the items stop moving, and then do the operation (i.e. check the special page and discard the special items) repeatedly until there is no item need to be discarded.  Consider the first example from the statement: n=10, m=4, k=5, p=[3,5,7,10]. The are two pages. Initially, the first page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). So Tokitsukaze discards the special items with indices 3 and 5. After, the first page remains to be special. It contains [1,2,4,6,7], Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index 7. After, the second page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). It contains [9,10], Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index 10.

As a result, we will get a sequence of length 2k\xe2\x88\x921.Less formally, we partition sequence of length 2k into 2k\xe2\x88\x921 pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth \xe2\x80\xa6, the last pair consists of the (2k\xe2\x88\x921)-th and (2k)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least 10, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by 10 (and don\'t change the order of the numbers).Perform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length 1. Let f([a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2k]) denote the number of candies we get in this process. For example: if the starting sequence is [8,7,3,1,7,0,9,4] then:After the first operation the sequence becomes [(8+7)mod10,(3+1)mod10,(7+0)mod10,(9+4)mod10] = [5,4,7,3], and we get 2 candies as 8+7\xe2\x89\xa510 and 9+4\xe2\x89\xa510.After the second operation the sequence becomes [(5+4)mod10,(7+3)mod10] = [9,0], and we get one more candy as 7+3\xe2\x89\xa510. After the final operation sequence becomes [(9+0)mod10] = [9]. Therefore, f([8,7,3,1,7,0,9,4])=3 as we got 3 candies in total.You are given a sequence of digits of length n s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6sn.

1189A "Keanu Reeves" strings "After playing Neo in the legendary ""Matrix"" trilogy, Keanu Reeves started doubting himself: maybe we really live in virtual reality? To find if this is true, he needs to solve the following problem.Let\'s call a string consisting of only zeroes and ones good if it contains different numbers of zeroes and ones. For example, 1, 101, 0000 are good, while 01, 1001, and 111000 are not good.We are given a string s of length n consisting of only zeroes and ones. We need to cut s into minimal possible number of substrings s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk such that all of them are good. More formally, we have to find minimal by number of strings sequence of good strings s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk such that their concatenation (joining) equals s, i.e. s1+s2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+sk=s.For example, cuttings 110010 into 110 and 010 or into 11 and 0010 are valid, as 110, 010, 11, 0010 are all good, and we can\'t cut 110010 to the smaller number of substrings as 110010 isn\'t good itself. At the same time, cutting of 110010 into 1100 and 10 isn\'t valid as both strings aren\'t good. Also, cutting of 110010 into 1, 1, 0010 isn\'t valid, as it isn\'t minimal, even though all 3 strings are good.Can you help Keanu? We can show that the solution always exists. If there are multiple optimal answers, print any." 800

In the beginning of the first minute each person is at the crossroad where he or she lives. As soon as a person reaches the crossroad number 1, he or she immediately comes to the leader\'s house and attends the meeting.Obviously, the leader wants all other members of the organization to come up as early as possible. But, since the organization is very secretive, the leader does not want to attract much attention.

In order to counter the invasion, she plans to deploy a trap in the Time Vortex, along a carefully chosen Time Corridor. She knows that tinkering with the Time Vortex is dangerous, so she consulted the Doctor on how to proceed. She has learned the following:  Different Time Corridors require different amounts of energy to keep stable.  Daleks are unlikely to use all corridors in their invasion. They will pick a set of Corridors that requires the smallest total energy to maintain, yet still makes (time) travel possible between any two destinations (for those in the know: they will use a minimum spanning tree).  Setting the trap may modify the energy required to keep the Corridor stable. Heidi decided to carry out a field test and deploy one trap, placing it along the first Corridor. But she needs to know whether the Daleks are going to use this corridor after the deployment of the trap. She gives you a map of Time Corridors (an undirected graph) with energy requirements for each Corridor.For a Corridor c, Emax(c) is the largest e\xe2\x89\xa4109 such that if we changed the required amount of energy of c to e, then the Daleks may still be using c in their invasion (that is, it belongs to some minimum spanning tree).

Well, it works using probabilities, which to some people is mysterious.At each unit time, when a decision is made, one of the two events will happen randomly. Let\'s denote l as the current length of the multiverse. With a probability of pcreate=1\xe2\x88\x92lm, a universe will be created. With a probability of pbreak=lm, a non-existent link will be broken at some position.More specifically,   When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. Each position occurs with a probability of 1l+1.   When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes, each with a probability of 1l\xe2\x88\x921. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. As earlier, the Doctor remains in the same universe. However, if at some point the multiverse breaks in such a way that the Doctor finds himself at the leftmost or rightmost end of it, the TARDIS stops functioning.In such a case, the Doctor must actually walk across the multiverse to find the tools to fix it.We are interested in the expected value of the length of the multiverse when such an event occurs." 3100

She was able to see all n universes lined up in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the Doctor was in the k-th universe.The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed m.Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will.

Unfortunately, this time the Daleks decided to abandon these tasks altogether, which means the Doctor has to deal with them.The Doctor can handle the Daleks on his own, but Heidi now has to make sure that the Cybermen are kept busy with this next task.There are k rings on a plane. For each ring, n points are uniformly sampled with a small random noise. The task is to recover the rings given only the noisy samples.The rings and the samples are generated as follows. The center of a ring is uniformly sampled from a disk of radius 1000000 centered at the origin, and the radius of the ring is uniformly sampled from [250000,750000]. Let R be a ring with center (x,y) and radius r. To sample a point from R, an angle \xce\xb8 is uniformly sampled from [0,2\xcf\x80] and a distance d is uniformly sampled from [0.9r,1.1r]. The coordinates of the sampled point are then (x+dcos(\xce\xb8),y+dsin(\xce\xb8)) rounded to the closest integers.The distance between rings is measured by their Hausdorff distance. In our case, the distance between two rings R1,R2 can be written as follow. Let d be the distance between the two centers and r1,r2 be the radii. Then the distance is dist(R1,R2)=max(min(d\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92,d\xe2\x88\x92+),min(d+\xe2\x88\x92,d++),min(d\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92,d+\xe2\x88\x92),min(d\xe2\x88\x92+,d++)), where d++=|d+r1+r2|, d+\xe2\x88\x92=|d+r1\xe2\x88\x92r2|, d\xe2\x88\x92+=|d\xe2\x88\x92r1+r2|, d\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92=|d\xe2\x88\x92r1\xe2\x88\x92r2|.We say that a ring R0 is recovered if one of the rings R in the output has Hausdorff distance less than 100000 from R0. An output is accepted if all the rings are recovered. It is guaranteed that the distances between any two rings is greater than 600000.Remember that a human can very easily solve this task, so make sure that no human traitors are helping the Cybermen complete this task." 3200

Therefore, whenever a base is attacked and its gold stolen, he makes sure to immediately refill that base with gold.Therefore, for the purposes of the rebels, multiple spaceships can attack the same base, in which case each spaceship will still receive all the gold of that base.The rebels have tasked Heidi and the Doctor to decide which set of spaceships to operate in order to maximize the total profit.However, as the war has been going on for a long time, the pilots have formed unbreakable bonds, and some of them refuse to operate spaceships if their friends are not also operating spaceships.They have a list of k dependencies of the form s1,s2, denoting that spaceship s1 can be operated only if spaceship s2 is also operated." 2700

Sasha has x chizhiks, Masha has y chizhiks. Each girl will buy as many coconuts as she can using only her money. This way each girl will buy an integer non-negative number of coconuts.The girls discussed their plans and found that the total number of coconuts they buy can increase (or decrease) if one of them gives several chizhiks to the other girl. The chizhiks can\'t be split in parts, so the girls can only exchange with integer number of chizhiks.Consider the following example. Suppose Sasha has 5 chizhiks, Masha has 4 chizhiks, and the price for one coconut be 3 chizhiks. If the girls don\'t exchange with chizhiks, they will buy 1+1=2 coconuts. However, if, for example, Masha gives Sasha one chizhik, then Sasha will have 6 chizhiks, Masha will have 3 chizhiks, and the girls will buy 2+1=3 coconuts. It is not that easy to live on the island now, so Sasha and Mash want to exchange with chizhiks in such a way that they will buy the maximum possible number of coconuts. Nobody wants to have a debt, so among all possible ways to buy the maximum possible number of coconuts find such a way that minimizes the number of chizhiks one girl gives to the other (it is not important who will be the person giving the chizhiks)." 1000

We call this sequence of actions an operation.For example, if deque was [2,3,4,5,1], on the operation he will write B=3 to the beginning and A=2 to the end, so he will get [3,4,5,1,2].The teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him q queries.

There are n parties, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th party has received ai seats in the parliament.Alice\'s party has number 1. In order to become the prime minister, she needs to build a coalition, consisting of her party and possibly some other parties. There are two conditions she needs to fulfil:   The total number of seats of all parties in the coalition must be a strict majority of all the seats, i.e. it must have strictly more than half of the seats. For example, if the parliament has 200 (or 201) seats, then the majority is 101 or more seats.  Alice\'s party must have at least 2 times more seats than any other party in the coalition. For example, to invite a party with 50 seats, Alice\'s party must have at least 100 seats. For example, if n=4 and a=[51,25,99,25] (note that Alice\'a party has 51 seats), then the following set [a1=51,a2=25,a4=25] can create a coalition since both conditions will be satisfied. However, the following sets will not create a coalition:  [a2=25,a3=99,a4=25] since Alice\'s party is not there;  [a1=51,a2=25] since coalition should have a strict majority;  [a1=51,a2=25,a3=99] since Alice\'s party should have at least 2 times more seats than any other party in the coalition. Alice does not have to minimise the number of parties in a coalition. If she wants, she can invite as many parties as she wants (as long as the conditions are satisfied). If Alice\'s party has enough people to create a coalition on her own, she can invite no parties.Note that Alice can either invite a party as a whole or not at all.

More specifically, the wardrobe has n doors (numbered from left to right) and the j-th door has width equal to aj wardrobe\'s cells. The wardrobe has single rails so that no two doors can slide past each other.  Extremely schematic example of a wardrobe: m=9, n=2, a1=2, a2=3. The problem is as follows: sometimes to open some cells you must close some other cells (since all doors are placed on the single track). For example, if you have a 4-compartment wardrobe (i.e. m=4) with n=2 one-cell doors (i.e. a1=a2=1) and you need to open the 1-st and the 3-rd cells, you have to close the 2-nd and the 4-th cells.As CEO, you have a complete schedule for the next q days. Now you are wondering: is it possible that all employees who will come on the k-th day can access their cells simultaneously?" -999
1170D "Decoding of Integer Sequences" "*special problem,data structures,implementation" "Polycarp is developing a method for transmitting n integer sequences over a network. This method should support the transmission of an arbitrary number of integer sequences; sequences can have different lengths. The sequences contain arbitrary non-negative integers.Polycarp developed the following encoding procedure:  We assume that the sequences are numbered from 1 to n.  We add a special terminating marker to each sequence at the end, an element equal to -1.  The encoding result is a new single sequence that contains all the elements of the specified n in a special order: first, add to the result of coding all the first elements of the sequences (in the order from the 1-st to the n-th), then all the second elements (in the order from the 1-st to the n-th) and so on, if the sequence does not have the corresponding element, then it is simply skipped. The process ends when all elements of all sequences are added. For example, if you want to encode three sequences [3,1,4], [2,7] and [1,2,3,4], then the sequence of actions will be as follows:  we modify all three sequences by appending -1: [3,1,4,\xe2\x88\x921], [2,7,\xe2\x88\x921] and [1,2,3,4,\xe2\x88\x921];  we write out all the first elements, we get [3,2,1];  then write down all the second elements, we get [3,2,1,1,7,2];  then write down all the third elements, we get [3,2,1,1,7,2,4,\xe2\x88\x921,3];  then write down all fourth elements, get [3,2,1,1,7,2,4,\xe2\x88\x921,3,\xe2\x88\x921,4] (note that the second sequence has already ended);  then write down all the fifth elements, we get [3,2,1,1,7,2,4,\xe2\x88\x921,3,\xe2\x88\x921,4,\xe2\x88\x921] (note that the first and second sequences have already ended);  all the sequences are ended now, and the encoding process is finished;  the encoding result is: [3,2,1,1,7,2,4,\xe2\x88\x921,3,\xe2\x88\x921,4,\xe2\x88\x921].

A leaf is a non-root vertex that has no children.In the tree Ilya has each vertex has at most two children, and each edge has some character written on it. The character can be a lowercase English letter or the question mark \'?\'.Ilya will q times update the tree a bit. Each update will replace exactly one character on some edge. After each update Ilya needs to find if the tree is anagrammable and if yes, find its anagramnity for each letter. Well, that\'s difficult to explain, but we\'ll try.To start with, a string a is an anagram of a string b if it is possible to rearrange letters in a (without changing the letters itself) so that it becomes b. For example, the string ""fortyfive"" is an anagram of the string ""overfifty"", but the string ""aabb"" is not an anagram of the string ""bbba"".Consider a path from the root of the tree to a leaf. The characters on the edges on this path form a string, we say that this string is associated with this leaf. The tree is anagrammable if and only if it is possible to replace each question mark with a lowercase English letter so that for all pair of leaves the associated strings for these leaves are anagrams of each other.If the tree is anagrammable, then its anagramnity for the letter c is the maximum possible number of letters c in a string associated with some leaf in a valid replacement of all question marks.Please after each update find if the tree is anagrammable and if yes, find the \xe2\x88\x91f(c)\xe2\x8b\x85ind(c) for all letters c, where f(c) is the anagramnity for the letter c, and ind(x) is the index of this letter in the alphabet (ind(""a"")=1, ind(""b"")=2, ..., ind(""z"")=26)." 3000

Luckily, we came up with a similar-looking scene which was a tiny bit cheaper to make.Firstly, forget about 3D, that\'s hard and expensive! The city is now represented as a number line (infinite to make it easier, of course).Secondly, the city doesn\'t have to look natural at all. There are nn buildings on the line. Each building is a square 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971. Buildings are numbered from 11 to nn in ascending order of their positions. Lower corners of building ii are at integer points aiai and ai+1ai+1 of the number line. Also the distance between any two neighbouring buildings ii and i+1i+1 doesn\'t exceed dd (really, this condition is here just to make the city look not that sparse). Distance between some neighbouring buildings ii and i+1i+1 is calculated from the lower right corner of building ii to the lower left corner of building i+1i+1.Finally, curvature of the bend is also really hard to simulate! Let the bend at some integer coordinate xx be performed with the following algorithm. Take the ray from xx to +\xe2\x88\x9e+\xe2\x88\x9e and all the buildings which are on this ray and start turning the ray and the buildings counter-clockwise around point xx. At some angle some building will touch either another building or a part of the line. You have to stop bending there (implementing buildings crushing is also not worth its money). Let\'s call the angle between two rays in the final state the terminal angle \xce\xb1x\xce\xb1x.The only thing left is to decide what integer point xx is the best to start bending around. Fortunately, we\'ve already chosen mm candidates to perform the bending.So, can you please help us to calculate terminal angle \xce\xb1x\xce\xb1x for each bend xx from our list of candidates?" 3100

Every other location contains one job.Each job has the following characteristics: work duration, the required number of workers, and also the earliest possible moment of starting the job and the latest possible moment of completing it. In order to complete the job, the required number of workers must simultaneously start working on it, and then be continuously present at the location for the duration of the job. Each job must either be fully done exactly once, or left untouched.Our task is to determine what should the workers do so that we have more profit. any worker can contribute to any job. We can use as many workers as we like, but each worker must take part in doing at least one job.Each worker starts at the base at a certain moment, then moves between locations and does the jobs, and finally gets back to the base and stops completely. A worker can move along coordinate axes, and spends one minute increasing or decreasing any one of his coordinates by 1. We have to pay the worker 240 credits for appearing in our solution, and additionally 1 credit per minute, up to the moment when the worker stops completely.We get rewarded for each job that is done.

If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is also zero.TestingYour solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. A solution\'s score is the sum of its results on all the tests. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is zero.During the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to submit a solution.  The first one, problem A1, is to check on examples. There are 10 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result. The tests for A1 are open, you can download them from the links https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.tar.gz (for Linux) and https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.zip (for Windows). After testing, you can click the verdict of your submission to see the result for each test.  The second way, problem A2, is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. After the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing;  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero;  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. Note that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.During final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same set of a large number (\xe2\x89\x881000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place." -999

If Serval hits its head or tail, the snake will bite him and he will die.Luckily, he has a special device which can answer the following question: you can pick a rectangle, it will tell you the number of times one needs to cross the border of the rectangle walking cell by cell along the snake from the head to the tail. The pictures below show a possible snake and a possible query to it, which will get an answer of 4.    Today Serval got up too late and only have time to make 2019 queries. As his best friend, can you help him find the positions of the head and the tail?Note that two cells are adjacent if and only if they have a common edge in the grid, and a snake can have a body of length 0, that means it only has adjacent head and tail.Also note that the snake is sleeping, so it won\'t move while Serval using his device. And what\'s obvious is that the snake position does not depend on your queries." 2200

As a talented boy in mathematics, he likes to play with numbers. This time, he wants to play with numbers on a rooted tree.A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. A parent of a node v is the last different from v vertex on the path from the root to the vertex v. Children of vertex v are all nodes for which v is the parent. A vertex is a leaf if it has no children.The rooted tree Serval owns has n nodes, node 1 is the root. Serval will write some numbers into all nodes of the tree. However, there are some restrictions. Each of the nodes except leaves has an operation max or min written in it, indicating that the number in this node should be equal to the maximum or minimum of all the numbers in its sons, respectively. Assume that there are k leaves in the tree. Serval wants to put integers 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,k to the k leaves (each number should be used exactly once). He loves large numbers, so he wants to maximize the number in the root. As his best friend, can you help him?" 1900

For example, parenthesis sequences ""()()"", ""(())"" are correct (the resulting expressions are: ""(1+1)+(1+1)"", ""((1+1)+1)""), while "")("" and "")"" are not. Note that the empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence by definition.We define that |s| as the length of string s. A strict prefix s[1\xe2\x80\xa6l] (1\xe2\x89\xa4l<|s|) of a string s=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6s|s| is string s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sl. Note that the empty string and the whole string are not strict prefixes of any string by the definition.Having learned these definitions, he comes up with a new problem. He writes down a string s containing only characters ""("", "")"" and ""?"". And what he is going to do, is to replace each of the ""?"" in s independently by one of ""("" and "")"" to make all strict prefixes of the new sequence not a correct parenthesis sequence, while the new sequence should be a correct parenthesis sequence.After all, he is just a primary school student so this problem is too hard for him to solve.

1142D Foreigner dp "Traveling around the world you noticed that many shop owners raise prices to inadequate values if the see you are a foreigner.You define inadequate numbers as follows:   all integers from 1 to 9 are inadequate;  for an integer x\xe2\x89\xa510 to be inadequate, it is required that the integer \xe2\x8c\x8ax/10\xe2\x8c\x8b is inadequate, but that\'s not the only condition. Let\'s sort all the inadequate integers. Let \xe2\x8c\x8ax/10\xe2\x8c\x8b have number k in this order. Then, the integer x is inadequate only if the last digit of x is strictly less than the reminder of division of k by 11. Here \xe2\x8c\x8ax/10\xe2\x8c\x8b denotes x/10 rounded down.Thus, if x is the m-th in increasing order inadequate number, and m gives the remainder c when divided by 11, then integers 10\xe2\x8b\x85x+0,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+1\xe2\x80\xa6,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+(c\xe2\x88\x921) are inadequate, while integers 10\xe2\x8b\x85x+c,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+(c+1),\xe2\x80\xa6,10\xe2\x8b\x85x+9 are not inadequate.The first several inadequate integers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,21,30,31,32\xe2\x80\xa6. After that, since 4 is the fourth inadequate integer, 40,41,42,43 are inadequate, while 44,45,46,\xe2\x80\xa6,49 are not inadequate; since 10 is the 10-th inadequate number, integers 100,101,102,\xe2\x80\xa6,109 are all inadequate. And since 20 is the 11-th inadequate number, none of 200,201,202,\xe2\x80\xa6,209 is inadequate.You wrote down all the prices you have seen in a trip. Unfortunately, all integers got concatenated in one large digit string s and you lost the bounds between the neighboring integers. You are now interested in the number of substrings of the resulting string that form an inadequate number. If a substring appears more than once at different positions, all its appearances are counted separately." 2800

Let\'s call such a parabola an U-shaped one.Vasya drew several distinct points with integer coordinates on a plane and then drew an U-shaped parabola through each pair of the points that have different x coordinates. The picture became somewhat messy, but Vasya still wants to count how many of the parabolas drawn don\'t have any drawn point inside their internal area. Help Vasya.The internal area of an U-shaped parabola is the part of the plane that lies strictly above the parabola when the y axis is directed upwards." 2400

Please answer the queries.A permutation of length n is a sequence of n integers such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.A cyclic shift of a permutation (p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn) is a permutation (pi,pi+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn,p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pi\xe2\x88\x921) for some i from 1 to n. For example, a permutation (2,1,3) has three distinct cyclic shifts: (2,1,3), (1,3,2), (3,2,1).A subsequence of a subsegment of array a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence ai1,ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aik for some i1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ik such that l\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ik\xe2\x89\xa4r." 2000

Sergey then forgot numbers s and l, but he remembers that the distance from the city s to the nearest fast food restaurant was a km, and the distance from the city he stopped at after traveling the first l km from s to the nearest fast food restaurant was b km. Sergey always traveled in the same direction along the circle, but when he calculated distances to the restaurants, he considered both directions.Now Sergey is interested in two integers. The first integer x is the minimum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to s. The second integer y is the maximum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to s." 1700

Each road will belong to one company and a company can own multiple roads.The government is afraid to look unfair. They think that people in a city can consider them unfair if there is one company which owns two or more roads entering the city. The government wants to make such privatization that the number of such cities doesn\'t exceed k and the number of companies taking part in the privatization is minimal.Choose the number of companies r such that it is possible to assign each road to one company in such a way that the number of cities that have two or more roads of one company is at most k. In other words, if for a city all the roads belong to the different companies then the city is good. Your task is to find the minimal r that there is such assignment to companies from 1 to r that the number of cities which are not good doesn\'t exceed k.  The picture illustrates the first example (n=6,k=2). The answer contains r=2 companies. Numbers on the edges denote edge indices. Edge colors mean companies: red corresponds to the first company, blue corresponds to the second company. The gray vertex (number 3) is not good.

1137F "Matches Are Not a Child\'s Play" "data structures,trees" "Lena is playing with matches. The natural question arising in the head of any child playing with matches is whether it\'s possible to set a tree on fire with a matches, or not.Let\'s say, that the tree is a connected graph without cycles and the vertices are labeled with integers 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n. Also every vertex vv has some integer priority pvpv associated with it. All priorities are distinct.It turns out, that if you set a tree on fire, it will burn to nothing. However, this process doesn\'t happen instantly. At the beginning, burns out the leaf (a vertex is called to be a leaf if it has only one adjacent vertex) of the tree of the minimum priority. Then burns out the leaf of the minimal priority of the remaining tree, and so on. This way, the vertices turn into the leaves and burn out until only one vertex remains. Then this vertex burns out as well.Lena has prepared a tree of nn vertices and every vertex in it has a priority pv=vpv=v. Lena is very curious about burning out this tree. However, she understands, that if she will burn the tree now, then it will disappear completely. Lena is a kind girl and she will feel bad for the burned tree, so she wants to study the process of burning the tree only in her mind. Lena wants to process qq queries, each of them is one of three following types:  ""up vv"", assign the vertex vv priority 1+max{p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn}1+max{p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn};  ""when vv"", find the step at which the vertex vv will burn out, if the tree would be set on fire now;  ""compare vv uu"", find out which of the vertices vv and uu will burn out first, if the tree would be set on fire now. Notice, that if all priorities would be distinct, then after the ""up"" query they will stay distinct as well. Initially all priorities are distinct, hence during any (purely hypothetical of course) burning of the tree, all leafs would have distinct priorities." 3400
1137E "Train Car Selection" "data structures,greedy" "Vasya likes to travel by train, but doesn\'t like when the car he travels in is located in the tail of the train.Vasya gets on the train at the station. The train consists of n cars indexed from 1 to n counting from the locomotive (head of the train). Three types of events occur while the train is moving:  Some number of cars are added to the head of the train;  Some number of cars are added to the tail of the train;  Vasya recalculates the values of the convenience of the cars (read more about it below). At each moment of time we will index the cars from the head of the train, starting from 1. Note that when adding new cars to the head of the train, the indexing of the old ones may shift.To choose which car to go in, Vasya will use the value Ai for each car (where i is a car index), which is calculated as follows:  At the beginning of the trip Ai=0, as well as for the new cars at the time of their addition.  During the next recalculation Vasya chooses some positive integers b and s and adds to all Ai value b+(i\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85s. Vasya hasn\'t decided yet where he will get on the train and where will get off the train, so after each event of one of the three types he wants to know the least index of the car, such that its value Ai is minimal. Since there is a lot of cars, Vasya asked you to write a program that answers his question." 2700
