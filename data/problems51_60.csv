Today he suggested ten his friends to play a cooperative game ""Lake"".Misha has already come up with a field for the upcoming game. The field for this game is a directed graph consisting of two parts. The first part is a road along the coast of the lake which is a cycle of c vertices. The second part is a path from home to the lake which is a chain of t vertices, and there is an edge from the last vertex of this chain to the vertex of the road along the coast which has the most beautiful view of the lake, also known as the finish vertex. Misha decided to keep the field secret, so nobody knows neither t nor c.  Note that each vertex of the field has exactly one outgoing edge and all the vertices except the home vertex and the finish vertex have exactly one ingoing edge. The home vertex has no incoming edges, the finish vertex has two incoming edges.At the beginning of the game pieces of all the ten players, indexed with consecutive integers from 0 to 9, are at the home vertex. After that on each turn some of the players can ask Misha to simultaneously move their pieces along the corresponding edges. Misha will not answer more than q such queries. After each move Misha will tell players whose pieces are at the same vertices and whose pieces are at different vertices.The goal of the game is to move all the pieces to the finish vertex.

1137A Skyscrapers implementation,sortings "Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.When Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn\'t change.Formally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n+m\xe2\x88\x921 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result ""greater"", ""smaller"" or ""equal"". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn\'t change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn\'t change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows:  Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons ""less"", ""equal"", ""greater"" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved)  The largest used number is 5, hence the answer for this intersection would be 5.Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection." 1600

Since Roman is beauty-lover, he decided to define the beauty of the string as the length of the longest substring, consisting of only one letter. For example, the beauty of the string ""xayyaaabca"" is equal to 3, since there is a substring ""aaa"", while the beauty of the string ""qwerqwer"" is equal to 1, since all neighboring symbols in it are different.In order to entertain Roman, Denis wrote down n strings p1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn on the paper and asked him to calculate the beauty of the string (\xe2\x80\xa6(((p1\xe2\x8b\x85p2)\xe2\x8b\x85p3)\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6)\xe2\x8b\x85pn, where s\xe2\x8b\x85t denotes a multiplication of strings s and t.

In the park, he saw that his favorite bench is occupied, and he had to sit down on the neighboring one. He sat down and began to listen to the silence. Suddenly, he got a question: what if in different parts of the park, the silence sounds in different ways? So it was. Let\'s divide the park into 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 meter squares and call them cells, and numerate rows from 11 to nn from up to down, and columns from 11 to mm from left to right.

In this task, a tree is a weighted connected graph, consisting of n vertices and n\xe2\x88\x921 edges, and weights of edges are integers from 1 to m. Kefa determines the beauty of a tree as follows: he finds in the tree his two favorite verticesÂ \xe2\x80\x94 vertices with numbers a and b, and counts the distance between them. The distance between two vertices x and y is the sum of weights of edges on the simple path from x to y.

There is one tap in the bowl which pumps s liters of patience per second. Notice that s can be negative, in that case, the tap pumps out the patience.

In the East all names are palindromes. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, such strings as ""kazak"", ""oo"" and ""r"" are palindromes, but strings ""abb"" and ""ij"" are not. Sasha believed that the hero would be named after one of the gods of the East. As long as there couldn\'t be two equal names, so in the East people did the following: they wrote the original name as a string on a piece of paper, then cut the paper minimum number of times k, so they got k+1 pieces of paper with substrings of the initial string, and then unite those pieces together to get a new string. Pieces couldn\'t be turned over, they could be shuffled.In this way, it\'s possible to achive a string abcdefg from the string f|de|abc|g using 3 cuts (by swapping papers with substrings f and abc). The string cbadefg can\'t be received using the same cuts.More formally, Sasha wants for the given palindrome s find such minimum k, that you can cut this string into k+1 parts, and then unite them in such a way that the final string will be a palindrome and it won\'t be equal to the initial string s.

1091H "New Year and the Tricolore Recreation" games "Alice and Bob play a game on a grid with n rows and infinitely many columns. In each row, there are three tokens, blue, white and red one. Before the game starts and after every move, the following two conditions must hold:   Any two tokens are not in the same cell.  In each row, the blue token is to the left of the white token, and the red token is to the right of the white token. First, they pick a positive integer f, whose value is valid for the whole game. Second, the starting player is chosen and makes his or her first turn. Then players take alternating turns. The player who is unable to make a move loses. During a move, a player first selects an integer k that is either a prime number or a product of two (not necessarily distinct) primes. The smallest possible values of k are thus 2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,\xe2\x80\xa6. Furthermore, k must not be equal to the previously picked integer f. Each turn, a move is performed in exactly one of the rows.If it is Alice\'s turn, she chooses a single blue token and moves it k cells to the right. Alternatively, she may move both the blue and the white token in the same row by the same amount k to the right.On the other hand, Bob selects a single red token and moves it k cells to the left. Similarly, he may also move the white and the red token in the corresponding row by k to the left.Note that Alice may never move a red token, while Bob may never move a blue one. Remember that after a move, the two conditions on relative positions of the tokens must still hold. Both players play optimally. Given the initial state of the board, determine who wins for two games: if Alice starts and if Bob starts." 3200

1089J "JS Minification" greedy,implementation "International Coding Procedures Company (ICPC) writes all its code in Jedi Script (JS) programming language. JS does not get compiled, but is delivered for execution in its source form. Sources contain comments, extra whitespace (including trailing and leading spaces), and other non-essential features that make them quite large but do not contribute to the semantics of the code, so the process of minification is performed on source files before their delivery to execution to compress sources while preserving their semantics.You are hired by ICPC to write JS minifier for ICPC. Fortunately, ICPC adheres to very strict programming practices and their JS sources are quite restricted in grammar. They work only on integer algorithms and do not use floating point numbers and strings. Every JS source contains a sequence of lines. Each line contains zero or more tokens that can be separated by spaces. On each line, a part of the line that starts with a hash character (\'#\' code 35), including the hash character itself, is treated as a comment and is ignored up to the end of the line.Each line is parsed into a sequence of tokens from left to right by repeatedly skipping spaces and finding the longest possible token starting at the current parsing position, thus transforming the source code into a sequence of tokens. All the possible tokens are listed below:  A reserved token is any kind of operator, separator, literal, reserved word, or a name of a library function that should be preserved during the minification process. Reserved tokens are fixed strings of non-space ASCII characters that do not contain the hash character (\'#\' code 35). All reserved tokens are given as an input to the minification process.  A number token consists of a sequence of digits, where a digit is a character from zero (\'0\') to nine (\'9\') inclusive.  A word token consists of a sequence of characters from the following set: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, underscore (\'_\' code 95), and dollar sign (\'$\' code 36). A word does not start with a digit. Note, that during parsing the longest sequence of characters that satisfies either a number or a word definition, but that appears in the list of reserved tokens, is considered to be a reserved token instead.During the minification process words are renamed in a systematic fashion using the following algorithm:  Take a list of words that consist only of lowercase letters ordered first by their length, then lexicographically: ""a"", ""b"", ..., ""z"", ""aa"", ""ab"", ..., excluding reserved tokens, since they are not considered to be words. This is the target word list.  Rename the first word encountered in the input token sequence to the first word in the target word list and all further occurrences of the same word in the input token sequence, too. Rename the second new word encountered in the input token sequence to the second word in the target word list, and so on. The goal of the minification process is to convert the given source to the shortest possible line (counting spaces) that still parses to the same sequence of tokens with the correspondingly renamed words using these JS parsing rules." 3200

The outcome is then determined depending on the chosen shapes: ""paper"" beats ""rock"", ""rock"" beats ""scissors"", ""scissors"" beat ""paper"", and two equal shapes result in a draw.At the start of the tournament all players will stand in a row, with their numbers increasing from 1 for the leftmost player, to n for the rightmost player. Each player has a pre-chosen shape that they will use in every game throughout the tournament. Here\'s how the tournament is conducted: If there is only one player left, he is declared the champion. Otherwise, two adjacent players in the row are chosen arbitrarily, and they play the next match. The losing player is eliminated from the tournament and leaves his place in the row (with his former neighbours becoming adjacent). If the game is a draw, the losing player is determined by a coin toss.The organizers are informed about all players\' favoured shapes. They wish to find out the total number of players who have a chance of becoming the tournament champion (that is, there is a suitable way to choose the order of the games and manipulate the coin tosses). However, some players are still optimizing their strategy, and can inform the organizers about their new shapes. Can you find the number of possible champions after each such request?" 2500

Application of template p to the string s is the replacement of each character in string s with pi, i is the index of this letter in the alphabet. For example, applying template ""bdca"" to a string ""aabccd"" yields string ""bbdcca"".Vasya wants to know if there exists such a template which yields a string lexicographically greater than or equal to string a and lexicographically less than or equal to string b after applying it to s.If there exist multiple suitable templates, print any of them.String a is lexicographically less than string b if there is some i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) that ai<bi and for any j (1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i) aj=bj.You are required to answer t testcases independently." 2300

Each plot can be uniquely described by integer Cartesian coordinates (x,y) of its south-west corner.Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Charlie are going to buy three distinct plots of land A,B,C in the forest. Initially, all plots in the forest (including the plots A,B,C) are covered by trees. The friends want to visit each other, so they want to clean some of the plots from trees. After cleaning, one should be able to reach any of the plots A,B,C from any other one of those by moving through adjacent cleared plots. Two plots are adjacent if they share a side.  For example, A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(2,2). The minimal number of plots to be cleared is 5. One of the ways to do it is shown with the gray color. Of course, the friends don\'t want to strain too much.

It was decided that elevator, when it is not used, will stay on the x-th floor, but x hasn\'t been chosen yet. When a person needs to get from floor a to floor b, elevator follows the simple algorithm:   Moves from the x-th floor (initially it stays on the x-th floor) to the a-th and takes the passenger.  Moves from the a-th floor to the b-th floor and lets out the passenger (if a equals b, elevator just opens and closes the doors, but still comes to the floor from the x-th floor).  Moves from the b-th floor back to the x-th.  The elevator never transposes more than one person and always goes back to the floor x before transposing a next passenger. The elevator spends one unit of electricity to move between neighboring floors. So moving from the a-th floor to the b-th floor requires |a\xe2\x88\x92b| units of electricity.Your task is to help Nut to find the minimum number of electricity units, that it would be enough for one day, by choosing an optimal the x-th floor.

1078E "Negative Time Summation" "constructive algorithms" "Everyone knows that computers become faster and faster. Recently Berland scientists have built a machine that can move itself back in time!More specifically, it works as follows. It has an infinite grid and a robot which stands on one of the cells. Each cell of the grid can either be empty or contain 0 or 1. The machine also has a program which consists of instructions, which are being handled one by one. Each instruction is represented by exactly one symbol (letter or digit) and takes exactly one unit of time (say, second) to be performed, except the last type of operation (it\'s described below). Here they are:  0 or 1: the robot places this number into the cell he is currently at. If this cell wasn\'t empty before the operation, its previous number is replaced anyway.  e: the robot erases the number into the cell he is at.  l, r, u or d: the robot goes one cell to the left/right/up/down.  s: the robot stays where he is for a unit of time.  t: let x be 0, if the cell with the robot is empty, otherwise let x be one more than the digit in this cell (that is, x=1 if the digit in this cell is 0, and x=2 if the digit is 1). Then the machine travels x seconds back in time. Note that this doesn\'t change the instructions order, but it changes the position of the robot and the numbers in the grid as they were x units of time ago. You can consider this instruction to be equivalent to a Ctrl-Z pressed x times. For example, let the board be completely empty, and the program be sr1t0. Let the robot initially be at (0,0).  [now is the moment 0, the command is s]: we do nothing.  [now is the moment 1, the command is r]: we are now at (1,0).  [now is the moment 2, the command is 1]: we are at (1,0), and this cell contains 1.  [now is the moment 3, the command is t]: we travel 1+1=2 moments back, that is, to the moment 1.  [now is the moment 1, the command is 0]: we are again at (0,0), and the board is clear again, but after we follow this instruction, this cell has 0 in it. We\'ve just rewritten the history. The consequences of the third instruction have never happened. Now Berland scientists want to use their machine in practice. For example, they want to be able to add two integers.Assume that the initial state of the machine is as follows:  One positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,1), from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit.  The other positive integer is written in binary on the grid in such a way that its right bit is at the cell (0,0), from left to right from the highest bit to the lowest bit.  All the other cells are empty.  The robot is at (0,0).  We consider this state to be always in the past; that is, if you manage to travel to any negative moment, the board was always as described above, and the robot was at (0,0) for eternity. You are asked to write a program after which  The robot stands on a non-empty cell,  If we read the number starting from the cell with the robot and moving to the right until the first empty cell, this will be a+b in binary, from the highest bit to the lowest bit. Note that there are no restrictions on other cells. In particular, there may be a digit just to the left to the robot after all instructions.In each test you are given up to 1000 pairs (a,b), and your program must work for all these pairs. Also since the machine\'s memory is not very big, your program must consist of no more than 105 instructions." 3400

Algoland consists of a cities numbered from 1 to a. The coordinates of the i-th Algoland city are a pair of integer numbers (xai,yai). Similarly, Berland consists of b cities numbered from 1 to b. The coordinates of the j-th Berland city are a pair of integer numbers (xbj,ybj). No three of the a+b mentioned cities lie on a single straight line.As the first step to unite the countries, Berland decided to build several bidirectional freeways. Each freeway is going to be a line segment that starts in a Berland city and ends in an Algoland city. Freeways can\'t intersect with each other at any point except freeway\'s start or end. Moreover, the freeways have to connect all a+b cities. Here, connectivity means that one can get from any of the specified a+b cities to any other of the a+b cities using freeways. Note that all freeways are bidirectional, which means that one can drive on each of them in both directions.Mayor of each of the b Berland cities allocated a budget to build the freeways that start from this city. Thus, you are given the numbers r1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rb, where rj is the number of freeways that are going to start in the j-th Berland city. The total allocated budget is very tight and only covers building the minimal necessary set of freeways.

1070G "Monsters and Potions" "brute force,dp,greedy,implementation" "Polycarp is an introvert person. In fact he is so much of an introvert that he plays ""Monsters and Potions"" board game alone. The board of the game is a row of n cells. The cells are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. There are three types of cells: a cell containing a single monster, a cell containing a single potion or a blank cell (it contains neither a monster nor a potion).Polycarp has m tokens representing heroes fighting monsters, which are initially located in the blank cells s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sm. Polycarp\'s task is to choose a single cell (rally point) and one by one move all the heroes into this cell. A rally point can be a cell of any of three types.After Policarp selects a rally point, he picks a hero and orders him to move directly to the point. Once that hero reaches the point, Polycarp picks another hero and orders him also to go to the point. And so forth, until all the heroes reach the rally point cell. While going to the point, a hero can not deviate from the direct route or take a step back. A hero just moves cell by cell in the direction of the point until he reaches it. It is possible that multiple heroes are simultaneously in the same cell.Initially the i-th hero has hi hit points (HP). Monsters also have HP, different monsters might have different HP. And potions also have HP, different potions might have different HP.If a hero steps into a cell which is blank (i.e. doesn\'t contain a monster/potion), hero\'s HP does not change.If a hero steps into a cell containing a monster, then the hero and the monster fight. If monster\'s HP is strictly higher than hero\'s HP, then the monster wins and Polycarp loses the whole game. If hero\'s HP is greater or equal to monster\'s HP, then the hero wins and monster\'s HP is subtracted from hero\'s HP. I.e. the hero survives if his HP drops to zero, but dies (and Polycarp looses) if his HP becomes negative due to a fight. If a hero wins a fight with a monster, then the monster disappears, and the cell becomes blank.If a hero steps into a cell containing a potion, then the hero drinks the potion immediately. As a result, potion\'s HP is added to hero\'s HP, the potion disappears, and the cell becomes blank.Obviously, Polycarp wants to win the game. It means that he must choose such rally point and the order in which heroes move, that every hero reaches the rally point and survives. I.e. Polycarp loses if a hero reaches rally point but is killed by a monster at the same time. Polycarp can use any of n cells as a rally point \xe2\x80\x94 initially it can contain a monster, a potion, or be a blank cell with or without a hero in it.Help Polycarp write a program to choose a rally point and the order in which heroes move." 2300

1070B Berkomnadzor "data structures,greedy" "BerkomnadzorÂ \xe2\x80\x94 Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass MediaÂ \xe2\x80\x94 is a Berland federal executive body that protects ordinary residents of Berland from the threats of modern internet.Berkomnadzor maintains a list of prohibited IPv4 subnets (blacklist) and a list of allowed IPv4 subnets (whitelist). All Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in Berland must configure the network equipment to block access to all IPv4 addresses matching the blacklist. Also ISPs must provide access (that is, do not block) to all IPv4 addresses matching the whitelist. If an IPv4 address does not match either of those lists, it\'s up to the ISP to decide whether to block it or not. An IPv4 address matches the blacklist (whitelist) if and only if it matches some subnet from the blacklist (whitelist). An IPv4 address can belong to a whitelist and to a blacklist at the same time, this situation leads to a contradiction (see no solution case in the output description).An IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer written in the form a.b.c.d, where each of the values a,b,c,d is called an octet and is an integer from 0 to 255 written in decimal notation. For example, IPv4 address 192.168.0.1 can be converted to a 32-bit number using the following expression 192\xe2\x8b\x85224+168\xe2\x8b\x85216+0\xe2\x8b\x8528+1\xe2\x8b\x8520. First octet a encodes the most significant (leftmost) 8 bits, the octets b and cÂ \xe2\x80\x94 the following blocks of 8 bits (in this order), and the octet d encodes the least significant (rightmost) 8 bits.The IPv4 network in Berland is slightly different from the rest of the world. There are no reserved or internal addresses in Berland and use all 232 possible values.An IPv4 subnet is represented either as a.b.c.d or as a.b.c.d/x (where 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa432). A subnet a.b.c.d contains a single address a.b.c.d. A subnet a.b.c.d/x contains all IPv4 addresses with x leftmost (most significant) bits equal to x leftmost bits of the address a.b.c.d. It is required that 32\xe2\x88\x92x rightmost (least significant) bits of subnet a.b.c.d/x are zeroes.Naturally it happens that all addresses matching subnet a.b.c.d/x form a continuous range. The range starts with address a.b.c.d (its rightmost 32\xe2\x88\x92x bits are zeroes). The range ends with address which x leftmost bits equal to x leftmost bits of address a.b.c.d, and its 32\xe2\x88\x92x rightmost bits are all ones. Subnet contains exactly 232\xe2\x88\x92x addresses. Subnet a.b.c.d/32 contains exactly one address and can also be represented by just a.b.c.d.For example subnet 192.168.0.0/24 contains range of 256 addresses. 192.168.0.0 is the first address of the range, and 192.168.0.255 is the last one.Berkomnadzor\'s engineers have devised a plan to improve performance of Berland\'s global network. Instead of maintaining both whitelist and blacklist they want to build only a single optimised blacklist containing minimal number of subnets. The idea is to block all IPv4 addresses matching the optimised blacklist and allow all the rest addresses. Of course, IPv4 addresses from the old blacklist must remain blocked and all IPv4 addresses from the old whitelist must still be allowed. Those IPv4 addresses which matched neither the old blacklist nor the old whitelist may be either blocked or allowed regardless of their accessibility before. Please write a program which takes blacklist and whitelist as input and produces optimised blacklist. The optimised blacklist must contain the minimal possible number of subnets and satisfy all IPv4 addresses accessibility requirements mentioned above. IPv4 subnets in the source lists may intersect arbitrarily. Please output a single number -1 if some IPv4 address matches both source whitelist and blacklist." 2400

In this dream Bob was swimming along one of the pool\'s lanes, but also there were some jellyfish swimming around him. It\'s worth mentioning that jellyfish have always been one of Bob\'s deepest childhood fears.Let us assume the following physical model for Bob\'s dream.  The pool\'s lane is an area of the plane between lines x=0 and x=w. Bob is not allowed to swim outside of the lane, but he may touch its bounding lines if he wants.  The jellyfish are very small, but in Bob\'s dream they are extremely swift. Each jellyfish has its area of activity around it. Those areas are circles of various radii, with the jellyfish sitting in their centers. The areas of activity of two jellyfish may overlap and one area of activity may even be fully contained within another one.  Bob has a shape of a convex polygon.  Unfortunately, Bob\'s excess weight has made him very clumsy, and as a result he can\'t rotate his body while swimming. So he swims in a parallel translation pattern. However at any given moment of time he can choose any direction of his movement.  Whenever Bob swims into a jellyfish\'s activity area, it will immediately notice him and sting him very painfully. We assume that Bob has swum into the activity area if at some moment of time the intersection of his body with the jellyfish\'s activity area had a positive area (for example, if they only touch, the jellyfish does not notice Bob).  Once a jellyfish stung Bob, it happily swims away and no longer poses any threat to Bob. Bob wants to swim the lane to its end and get stung the least possible number of times.

Let\'s number them from 1 to n. With one swing of the scissors the hairdresser can shorten all hairlines on any segment to the length l, given that all hairlines on that segment had length strictly greater than l. The hairdresser wants to complete his job as fast as possible, so he will make the least possible number of swings of scissors, since each swing of scissors takes one second.Alice hasn\'t decided yet when she would go to the hairdresser, so she asked you to calculate how much time the haircut would take depending on the time she would go to the hairdresser.

The first task he has to become familiar with is to assemble an electric scheme.The scheme Pasha assembled yesterday consists of several wires. Each wire is a segment that connects two points on a plane with integer coordinates within the segment [1,109].There are wires of two colors in the scheme:   red wires: these wires are horizontal segments, i.e. if such a wire connects two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), then y1=y2;  blue wires: these wires are vertical segments, i.e. if such a wire connects two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), then x1=x2. Note that if a wire connects a point to itself, it may be blue, and it can be red. Also, in Pasha\'s scheme no two wires of the same color intersect, i.e. there are no two wires of same color that have common points.The imperfection of Pasha\'s scheme was that the wires were not isolated, so in the points where two wires of different colors intersect, Pasha saw sparks. Pasha wrote down all the points where he saw sparks and obtained a set of n distinct points. After that he disassembled the scheme.Next morning Pasha looked at the set of n points where he had seen sparks and wondered how many wires had he used. Unfortunately, he does not remember that, so he wonders now what is the smallest number of wires he might have used in the scheme.

No two segments share any common points. When the glider is inside one of such segments, he doesn\'t descend, so his second coordinate stays the same each second. The glider still flies along Ox axis, covering one unit of distance every second.   If the glider jumps out at 1, he will stop at 10. Otherwise, if he jumps out at 2, he will stop at 12. Determine the maximum distance along Ox axis from the point where the glider\'s flight starts to the point where his flight ends if the glider can choose any integer coordinate to jump from the plane and start his flight. After touching the ground the glider stops altogether, so he cannot glide through an ascending airflow segment if his second coordinate is 0." 1700

However, Monocarp\'s boss doesn\'t like when Monocarp takes his coffee breaks too often. So for the given coffee break that is going to be on minute ai, Monocarp must choose the day in which he will drink coffee during the said minute, so that every day at least d minutes pass between any two coffee breaks. Monocarp also wants to take these n coffee breaks in a minimum possible number of working days (he doesn\'t count days when he is not at work, and he doesn\'t take coffee breaks on such days). Take into account that more than d minutes pass between the end of any working day and the start of the following working day.For each of the n given minutes determine the day, during which Monocarp should take a coffee break in this minute.

Monocarp is also used to TV sets with a certain aspect ratio: formally, if the width of the screen is w, and the height of the screen is h, then the following condition should be met: wh=xy.There are many different TV sets in the shop. Monocarp is sure that for any pair of positive integers w and h there is a TV set with screen width w and height h in the shop.Monocarp isn\'t ready to choose the exact TV set he is going to buy. Firstly he wants to determine the optimal screen resolution. He has decided to try all possible variants of screen size. But he must count the number of pairs of positive integers w and h, beforehand, such that (w\xe2\x89\xa4a), (h\xe2\x89\xa4b) and (wh=xy).In other words, Monocarp wants to determine the number of TV sets having aspect ratio xy, screen width not exceeding a, and screen height not exceeding b.

There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.This time Miroslav laid out n skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from 1 to n in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number i, it leads to turning k closest skewers from each side of the skewer i, that is, skewers number i\xe2\x88\x92k, i\xe2\x88\x92k+1, ..., i\xe2\x88\x921, i+1, ..., i+k\xe2\x88\x921, i+k (if they exist). For example, let n=6 and k=1. When Miroslav turns skewer number 3, then skewers with numbers 2, 3, and 4 will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number 1, then skewers number 1, 3, and 4 will be turned over, while skewer number 2 will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all n skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example n=6 and k=1, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number 2 and 5.Help Miroslav turn over all n skewers." 1300

A palindrome is a sequence that is the same when read from left to right and when read from right to left. The director liked the idea, and she wants to buy suits so that the color of the leftmost dancer\'s suit is the same as the color of the rightmost dancer\'s suit, the 2nd left is the same as 2nd right, and so on.The director knows how many burls it costs to buy a white suit, and how many burls to buy a black suit. You need to find out whether it is possible to buy suits to form a palindrome, and if it\'s possible, what\'s the minimal cost of doing so. Remember that dancers can not change positions, and due to bureaucratic reasons it is not allowed to buy new suits for the dancers who already have suits, even if it reduces the overall spending." 1000

The j-th piece of the function is the segment PjPj+1.In one move you can increase the y-coordinate of any point with odd x-coordinate (i.e. such points are P1,P3,\xe2\x80\xa6,P2n\xe2\x88\x921) by 1. Note that the corresponding segments also change.For example, the following plot shows a function for n=3 (i.e. number of points is 2\xe2\x8b\x853+1=7) in which we increased the y-coordinate of the point P1 three times and y-coordinate of the point P5 one time:  Let the area of the plot be the area below this plot and above the coordinate axis OX. For example, the area of the plot on the picture above is 4 (the light blue area on the picture above is the area of the plot drawn on it).Let the height of the plot be the maximum y-coordinate among all initial points in the plot (i.e. points P0,P1,\xe2\x80\xa6,P2n).

Each ""number gate"" takes two registers as inputs and calculates a function of the two values stored in those registers. Note that you can use the same register as both inputs.Each ""number gate"" is assembled from bit gates. There are six types of bit gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOTÂ AND, NOTÂ OR, and NOTÂ XOR, denoted ""A"", ""O"", ""X"", ""a"", ""o"", ""x"", respectively. Each bit gate takes two bits as input. Its output given the input bits b1, b2 is given below: b1b2AOXaox00000111010111001001110011110001 To build a ""number gate"", one takes w bit gates and assembles them into an array. A ""number gate"" takes two w-bit integers x1 and x2 as input. The ""number gate"" splits the integers into w bits and feeds the i-th bit of each input to the i-th bit gate. After that, it assembles the resulting bits again to form an output word. For instance, for 4-bit computer we might have a ""number gate"" ""AXoA"" (AND, XOR, NOT OR, AND).

In this problem no two ever existed orders will have the same price.The lowest-price SELL order and the highest-price BUY order are called the best offers, marked with black frames on the picture below.  The presented order book says that someone wants to sell the product at price 12 and it\'s the best SELL offer because the other two have higher prices. The best BUY offer has price 10. There are two possible actions in this orderbook:  Somebody adds a new order of some direction with some price. Somebody accepts the best possible SELL or BUY offer (makes a deal). It\'s impossible to accept not the best SELL or BUY offer (to make a deal at worse price). After someone accepts the offer, it is removed from the orderbook forever.It is allowed to add new BUY order only with prices less than the best SELL offer (if you want to buy stock for higher price, then instead of adding an order you should accept the best SELL offer).

All points in each engine are different.You can manipulate each engine separately. There are two operations that you can do with each engine. You can do each operation as many times as you want. For every power source as a whole in that engine: (xi,yi) becomes (xi+a,yi+b), a and b can be any real numbers. In other words, all power sources will be shifted.

In other words, all power sources will be rotated.The engines work as follows: after the two engines are powered, their power sources are being combined (here power sources of different engines may coincide). If two power sources A(xa,ya) and B(xb,yb) exist, then for all real number k that 0<k<1, a new power source will be created Ck(kxa+(1\xe2\x88\x92k)xb,kya+(1\xe2\x88\x92k)yb).

He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car.The path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it\'s not that straight in reality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is n km. Let\'s say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate 0 km, and Saratov \xe2\x80\x94 at coordinate n km.Driving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered i kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering (i+1)-th kilometer as ai+1.

Every integer point from 1 to n\xe2\x88\x921 may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty a1, the kilometer after it \xe2\x80\x94 difficulty a2, and so on.For example, if n=5 and there is a rest site in coordinate 2, the difficulty of journey will be 2a1+2a2+a3: the first kilometer will have difficulty a1, the second one \xe2\x80\x94 a2, then Leha will have a rest, and the third kilometer will have difficulty a1, the fourth \xe2\x80\x94 a2, and the last one \xe2\x80\x94 a3. Another example: if n=7 and there are rest sites in coordinates 1 and 5, the difficulty of Leha\'s journey is 3a1+2a2+a3+a4.Leha doesn\'t know which integer points contain rest sites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are 2n\xe2\x88\x921 different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are different if there exists some point x such that it contains a rest site in exactly one of these distributions).

The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer a is the direct superior of officer b, then we also can say that officer b is a direct subordinate of officer a.Officer x is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer y if one of the following conditions holds:  officer y is the direct superior of officer x;  the direct superior of officer x is a subordinate of officer y. For example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer 3 are: 5,6,7,8,9.The structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.Formally, let\'s represent Berland army as a tree consisting of n vertices, in which vertex u corresponds to officer u. The parent of vertex u corresponds to the direct superior of officer u. The root (which has index 1) corresponds to the commander of the army.Berland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on q queries, the i-th query is given as (ui,ki), where ui is some officer, and ki is a positive integer.To process the i-th query imagine how a command from ui spreads to the subordinates of ui. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.Suppose the current officer is a and he spreads a command. Officer a chooses b \xe2\x80\x94 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then a chooses the one having minimal index. Officer a gives a command to officer b. Afterwards, b uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After b finishes spreading the command, officer a chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer a cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn\'t received this command, officer a finishes spreading the command.Let\'s look at the following example:  If officer 1 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [1,2,3,5,6,8,7,9,4].If officer 3 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [3,5,6,8,7,9].If officer 7 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [7,9].If officer 9 spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: [9].To answer the i-th query (ui,ki), construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the ui-th officer spreads it.

The median of [7,1,2,9,6] equals 6 since after sorting, the value 6 will be in the middle of the sequence.Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices (l,r) (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n) such that the value of the median of pl,pl+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,pr is exactly the given number m." 1800

Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by 3. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after m such cuts, there will be m+1 parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by 3.For example, if the original number is s=3121, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts: 3|1|21. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by 3.Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character \'0\'). For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid.What is the maximum number of numbers divisible by 3 that Polycarp can obtain?" 1500

All streets are two-way and connect two junctions. It is possible to travel from any junction to any other using one or more streets. City Hall allows opening shops only on junctions. The girl cannot open shops in the middle of streets. Sonya has exactly k friends whom she can trust. If she opens a shop, one of her friends has to work there and not to allow anybody to eat an ice cream not paying for it. Since Sonya does not want to skip an important competition, she will not work in shops personally.Sonya wants all her ice cream shops to form a simple path of the length r (1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4k), i.e. to be located in different junctions f1,f2,\xe2\x80\xa6,fr and there is street between fi and fi+1 for each i from 1 to r\xe2\x88\x921.The girl takes care of potential buyers, so she also wants to minimize the maximum distance between the junctions to the nearest ice cream shop.

1004D "Sonya and Matrix" "brute force,constructive algorithms,implementation" "Since Sonya has just learned the basics of matrices, she decided to play with them a little bit.Sonya imagined a new type of matrices that she called rhombic matrices. These matrices have exactly one zero, while all other cells have the Manhattan distance to the cell containing the zero. The cells with equal numbers have the form of a rhombus, that is why Sonya called this type so.The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined as |x1\xe2\x88\x92x2|+|y1\xe2\x88\x92y2|. For example, the Manhattan distance between the cells (5,2) and (7,1) equals to |5\xe2\x88\x927|+|2\xe2\x88\x921|=3.  Example of a rhombic matrix. Note that rhombic matrices are uniquely defined by n, m, and the coordinates of the cell containing the zero.She drew a n\xc3\x97m rhombic matrix. She believes that you can not recreate the matrix if she gives you only the elements of this matrix in some arbitrary order (i.e., the sequence of n\xe2\x8b\x85m numbers). Note that Sonya will not give you n and m, so only the sequence of numbers in this matrix will be at your disposal.Write a program that finds such an n\xc3\x97m rhombic matrix whose elements are the same as the elements in the sequence in some order." 2300

She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.Sonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.For example, if the numbers [1,5,4,1,3] are written, and Sonya gives the number 1 to the first robot and the number 4 to the second one, the first robot will stop in the 1-st position while the second one in the 3-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number 4 to the first robot and the number 5 to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the 3-rd position while the second one is in the 2-nd position.Sonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.Sonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs (p, q), where she will give p to the first robot and q to the second one. Pairs (pi, qi) and (pj, qj) are different if pi\xe2\x89\xa0pj or qi\xe2\x89\xa0qj.Unfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch.

This value is calculated as follows:Suppose we want to analyze the segment of n consecutive days. We have measured the temperatures during these n days; the temperature during i-th day equals ai.We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days.

The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1.

The cell (i,j) of the adjacency matrix contains 1 if and only if the i-th and j-th vertices in the graph are connected by an edge.A connected component is a set of vertices X such that for every two vertices from this set there exists at least one path in the graph connecting this pair of vertices, but adding any other vertex to X violates this rule.The complement or inverse of a graph G is a graph H on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of H are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in G." 1700

Further, every second all the dancers standing on the platform with number i jump to the platform with the number f(i).

That allowed to loop the clip and collect even more likes.PSY knows that enhanced versions of old artworks become more and more popular every day. So he decided to release a remastered-version of his video.In his case ""enhanced version"" means even more insanity, so the number of platforms can be up to 1018!

Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.The paper is divided into n pieces enumerated from 1 to n. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the i-th piece has color ci where ci=0 defines black color, ci=1 defines white color and ci=\xe2\x88\x921 means that the piece hasn\'t been colored yet.The rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color (0 or 1) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors.

Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns (u,v) if on the path from u to v, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\xe2\x80\x99s body and sting him.Kuro wants to know how many pair of city (u,v) he can take as his route.

Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.The three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.A random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let\'s call a consecutive subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon. For example, the ribbon aaaaaaa has the beauty of 7 because its subribbon a appears 7 times, and the ribbon abcdabc has the beauty of 2 because its subribbon abc appears twice.The rules are simple. The game will have n turns. Every turn, each of the cats must change strictly one color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is different from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon aaab can be changed into acab in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after n turns wins the treasure.Could you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?" 1800

Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.At first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn\'t always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.Given an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly." 1600

Also 2 instructors live in this house.The process of curfew enforcement is the following. One instructor starts near room 1 and moves toward room n, while the second instructor starts near room n and moves toward room 1. After processing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both instructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if n is odd, then only the first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are processed, the process ends.When an instructor processes a room, she counts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and locks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don\'t care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students.While instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing. In each room any number of students can hide simultaneously.Formally, here is what\'s happening:  A curfew is announced, at this point in room i there are ai students.  Each student can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her initial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors enter room 1 and room n, they count students there and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room).

949C "Data Center Maintenance" "dfs and similar,graphs" "BigData Inc. is a corporation that has n data centers indexed from 1 to n that are located all over the world. These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!).Main feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers.For each of m company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as ci,\xe2\x80\x891 and ci,\xe2\x80\x892.In order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly. Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new version of software is being deployed to the data center computers each day.Data center software update is a non-trivial long process, that is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated for data center maintenance. During the maintenance period, data center computers are installing software updates, and thus they may be unavailable. Consider the day to be exactly h hours long. For each data center there is an integer uj (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89uj\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89h\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891) defining the index of an hour of day, such that during this hour data center j is unavailable due to maintenance.Summing up everything above, the condition uci,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89uci,\xe2\x80\x892 should hold for each client, or otherwise his data may be unaccessible while data centers that store it are under maintenance.Due to occasional timezone change in different cities all over the world, the maintenance time in some of the data centers may change by one hour sometimes. Company should be prepared for such situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment, choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if uj\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89h\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891, then the new maintenance hour would become 0, otherwise it would become uj\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891). Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed.Such an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data accessibility guarantees." 1900

The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in a-th inflorescence gets to pa-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time.Help Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest." 1500

928D Autocompletion "*special problem,strings,trees" "Arcady is a copywriter. His today\'s task is to type up an already well-designed story using his favorite text editor.Arcady types words, punctuation signs and spaces one after another. Each letter and each sign (including line feed) requires one keyboard click in order to be printed. Moreover, when Arcady has a non-empty prefix of some word on the screen, the editor proposes a possible autocompletion for this word, more precisely one of the already printed words such that its prefix matches the currently printed prefix if this word is unique. For example, if Arcady has already printed \xc2\xabcodeforces\xc2\xbb, \xc2\xabcoding\xc2\xbb and \xc2\xabcodeforces\xc2\xbb once again, then there will be no autocompletion attempt for \xc2\xabcod\xc2\xbb, but if he proceeds with \xc2\xabcode\xc2\xbb, the editor will propose \xc2\xabcodeforces\xc2\xbb.With a single click Arcady can follow the editor\'s proposal, i.e. to transform the current prefix to it. Note that no additional symbols are printed after the autocompletion (no spaces, line feeds, etc). What is the minimum number of keyboard clicks Arcady has to perform to print the entire text, if he is not allowed to move the cursor or erase the already printed symbols?A word here is a contiguous sequence of latin letters bordered by spaces, punctuation signs and line/text beginnings/ends. Arcady uses only lowercase letters. For example, there are 20 words in \xc2\xabit\'s well-known that tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, x and o.\xc2\xbb." 1900

Each project (keep in mind that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies.You\'re given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on (directly or via a certain chain). It\'s possible that Polycarp\'s project depends on two different versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp\'s project. If there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies are ignored.More formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible size that the following conditions hold:   Polycarp\'s project is chosen;  Polycarp\'s project depends (directly or indirectly) on all other projects in the set;  no two projects share the name;  for each project x that some other project in the set depends on we have either x or some y with other version and shorter chain to Polycarp\'s project chosen. In case of ties the newer one is chosen. Output all Polycarp\'s project\'s dependencies (Polycarp\'s project itself should\'t be printed) in lexicographical order." 1900

Luckily there are social networksÂ \xe2\x80\x94 they store all your message history making it easy to know what you argued over 10 years ago.More formal, your message history is a sequence of messages ordered by time sent numbered from 1 to n where n is the total number of messages in the chat.Each message might contain a link to an earlier message which it is a reply to. When opening a message x or getting a link to it, the dialogue is shown in such a way that k previous messages, message x and k next messages are visible (with respect to message x). In case there are less than k messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.Digging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message x (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.Determine the number of messages you\'ll read if your start from message number t for all t from 1 to n.

927A "BuberPool Taxi Optimization" "*special problem,interactive" "This is an interactive optimization problem. Instead of having to find the best answer, each solution will get score according to its efficiency. As the problem is interactive, during the testing process, the jury program and your solution will exchange messages via standard input and output streams. After printing a message, remember to flush the output buffer to ensure that the message is fully sent. For example, you can use fflush(stdout) in C++, System.out.flush() in Java, flush(output) in Pascal, and stdout.flush() in Python.Your task is to automate the next generation taxi service, BuberPool. Each Buber car may transport up to four passengers at a time. The cars have to drive to passengers\' locations, pick them up and drive them to their destinations. Additionally, unlike a traditional taxi, each car can process up to four orders simultaneously. For example, when driving a passenger to the destination, a car can pick up an additional passenger, or make a detour to drop off another passenger.We will use the following simplified discrete model for this real-life problem.Consider a city as a rectangular grid of w streets and h avenues with w\xc3\x97h crossroads. The streets are numbered from 1 to w, and the avenues from 1 to h. We will consider non-negative integer moments of time. Actions are performed in ticks: intervals of time between consecutive moments. At any moment, each car is located at some crossroads (x,y), where 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4w and 1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4h. Any number of cars can be at the same crossroads simultaneously. During one tick, each car can either remain on the same crossroads or change exactly one of its coordinates, the street or the avenue, by one.At moment 0, you are given starting locations of k cars: (x1,y1), (x2,y2), \xe2\x80\xa6, (xk,yk). The number of cars is equal to k and does not change during the simulation.Additionally, your solution will be given the clients\' orders. In this problem, each order is made by a single passenger, so a car can process up to four orders at the same time. To further simplify the problem, the moments of orders are all distinct, and the orders are given in chronological order. So, each j-th order is described by five integers: the moment tj, the pick up location (sxj,syj), and the drop-off location (txj,tyj).On tick 0, and also right after receiving each order, you can give instruction sets to the car drivers. Each time you can give instruction sets to any number of cars (more on restrictions later). Instruction sets for different cars are given separately. An instruction set is a sequence of triples (cx1,cy1,a1), (cx2,cy2,a2), \xe2\x80\xa6, (cxm,cym,am), where m is number of instructions in the set. The meaning of these numbers is as follows:  A car should first drive to (cx1,cy1), then to (cx2,cy2), \xe2\x80\xa6, and at last to (cxm,cym). Each location (cxi,cyi) may be any crossroads in the city, not necessarily a pickup or drop-off location. While driving from one location to another, a car always first changes its first coordinate until it is equal to the first coordinate of the destination, and only then the second coordinate. This way, while driving from (p1,q1) to (p2,q2), a car will first move (p1,q1)\xe2\x86\x92(p2,q1), and then (p2,q1)\xe2\x86\x92(p2,q2). In each tick while moving, a car changes exactly one of its coordinates by one.  Values ai encode actions. If ai=0, the car just drives to (cxi,cyi) and doesn\'t do anything special. If ai>0, the car drives to (cxi,cyi) and picks up passenger number ai there (the passenger\'s pickup location should be equal to (cxi,cyi), and the passenger should still be waiting there). If ai<0, the car moves to (cxi,cyi) and drops off passenger number \xe2\x88\x92ai (the passenger\'s drop-off location should be equal to (cxi,cyi), and the passenger should be in this car). Picking up and dropping off passengers are instant. When you give instruction set to a car, its previous instruction set is replaced with the new one. This way, a car only performs at most one instruction set at a time. If there are no instructions, or all of them are completed, the car is waiting at its last location. Instructions are performed in the given order.For each order, first, all the cars perform their current instruction sets until the moment of the order comes, then the order is given to your program, and after that, your program prints new instruction sets for some of the cars. The cars which don\'t get new instruction sets continue performing their old ones.So, the overall testing strategy looks like this:  Your solution reads the city dimensions, the number of cars, and their initial coordinates.  The solution prints instruction sets for some cars, and the cars start performing the instructions.  The solution reads an integer tj, the moment of the next order (if tj=\xe2\x88\x921, your program should print the final instruction sets and exit normally).  The solution reads integers sxj, syj, txj, tyj, the pickup and drop-off locations for j-th order.  The solution prints the next instruction sets for the cars.  Go to step 3. After your program exits in step 3, first, all instructions will be completely performed, and only after that the simulation will end.The score your solution gets for a test is the average score for all orders, rounded to the nearest integer. The score for an order equals \xce\xb1\xe2\x8b\x85(100+w0), where w0 is time the order takes in the ideal case, which is just the time to get from (sxj,syj) to (txj,tyj) (so, w0=|sxj\xe2\x88\x92txj|+|syj\xe2\x88\x92tyj|), and \xce\xb1 is a real value between 0 and 1 which characterizes the passenger\'s satisfaction with the ride.

In the i-th nest there are ci birds; to summon one bird from this nest Imp needs to stay under this tree and it costs him costi points of mana. However, for each bird summoned, Imp increases his mana capacity by B points. Imp summons birds one by one, he can summon any number from 0 to ci birds from the i-th nest. Initially Imp stands under the first tree and has W points of mana, and his mana capacity equals W as well. He can only go forward, and each time he moves from a tree to the next one, he restores X points of mana (but it can\'t exceed his current mana capacity). Moving only forward, what is the maximum number of birds Imp can summon?" 2200
922D "Robot Vacuum Cleaner" greedy,sortings "Pushok the dog has been chasing Imp for a few hours already.  Fortunately, Imp knows that Pushok is afraid of a robot vacuum cleaner. While moving, the robot generates a string t consisting of letters \'s\' and \'h\', that produces a lot of noise. We define noise of string t as the number of occurrences of string ""sh"" as a subsequence in it, in other words, the number of such pairs (i,\xe2\x80\x89j), that i\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89j and  and . The robot is off at the moment. Imp knows that it has a sequence of strings ti in its memory, and he can arbitrary change their order. When the robot is started, it generates the string t as a concatenation of these strings in the given order. The noise of the resulting string equals the noise of this concatenation.Help Imp to find the maximum noise he can achieve by changing the order of the strings." 1800
922C "Cave Painting" "brute force,number theory" "Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting.  Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all , 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k, are distinct, i.Â e. there is no such pair (i,\xe2\x80\x89j) that:   1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89j\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k,  , where  is the remainder of division x by y." 1600
922B "Magic Forest" "brute force" "Imp is in a magic forest, where xorangles grow (wut?)  A xorangle of order n is such a non-degenerate triangle, that lengths of its sides are integers not exceeding n, and the xor-sum of the lengths is equal to zero. Imp has to count the number of distinct xorangles of order n to get out of the forest. Formally, for a given integer n you have to find the number of such triples (a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c), that:  1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n;  , where  denotes the bitwise xor of integers x and y.  (a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c) form a non-degenerate (with strictly positive area) triangle." 1300
922A "Cloning Toys" implementation "Imp likes his plush toy a lot.  Recently, he found a machine that can clone plush toys. Imp knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.Initially, Imp has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly x copied toys and y original toys? He can\'t throw toys away, and he can\'t apply the machine to a copy if he doesn\'t currently have any copies." 1300
