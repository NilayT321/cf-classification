2036G "Library of Magic" "binary search, constructive algorithms, divide and conquer, interactive, math, number theory" "This is an interactive problem.
The Department of Supernatural Phenomena at the Oxenfurt Academy has opened the Library of Magic, which contains the works of the greatest sorcerers of Redania \xe2\x80\x94 n (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41018) types of books, numbered from 1 to n. Each book\'s type number is indicated on its spine. Moreover, each type of book is stored in the library in exactly two copies! And you have been appointed as the librarian.
One night, you wake up to a strange noise and see a creature leaving the building through a window. Three thick tomes of different colors were sticking out of the mysterious thief\'s backpack. Before you start searching for them, you decide to compute the numbers a, b, and c written on the spines of these books. All three numbers are distinct.
So, you have an unordered set of tomes, which includes one tome with each of the pairwise distinct numbers a, b, and c, and two tomes for all numbers from 1 to n, except for a, b, and c. You want to find these values a, b, and c.
Since you are not working in a simple library, but in the Library of Magic, you can only use one spell in the form of a query to check the presence of books in their place: 
Since your magical abilities as a librarian are severely limited, you can make no more than 150 queries.
The first line of input contains an integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4300) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41018) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of types of tomes.
The interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n.
Then you can make up to 150 queries.
To make a query, output a string in the format ""xor l r"" (without quotes) (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n). After each query, read an integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to your query.
To report the answer, output a string in the format ""ans a b c"" (without quotes), where a, b, and c are the numbers you found as the answer to the problem. You can output them in any order.
The interactor is not adaptive, which means that the answer is known before the participant makes queries and does not depend on the queries made by the participant.
After making 150 queries, the answer to any other query will be \xe2\x88\x921. Upon receiving such an answer, terminate the program to receive a verdict of ""WA"" (Wrong answer).
After outputting a query, do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive a verdict of ""IL"" (Idleness limit exceeded). To flush the buffer, use: 
Hacks
To make a hack, use the following format.
The first line should contain a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4300) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case should contain four integers n, a, b, and c (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41018, 1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of books in the library and the numbers of the stolen tomes. The numbers a, b, and c must be distinct.
In the first test case, the books in the library after the theft look like this:

Now consider the answers to the queries: 
In the second test case, there are only 3 types of books, and it is easy to guess that the missing ones have the numbers 1, 2, and 3." "2200  x990"

Bob considers a positive integer x to be interesting if it satisfies x\xe2\x89\xa2k(mod2i). Therefore, this year for his birthday, she gifted him a super-powerful ""XORificator 3000"", the latest model.
Bob was very pleased with the gift, as it allowed him to instantly compute the XOR of all interesting integers in any range from l to r, inclusive. After all, what else does a person need for happiness? Unfortunately, the device was so powerful that at one point it performed XOR with itself and disappeared. Bob was very upset, and to cheer him up, Alice asked you to write your version of the ""XORificator"".
The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of XOR queries on the segment.

2036E "Reverse the Rivers" "binary search, constructive algorithms, data structures, greedy" "A conspiracy of ancient sages, who decided to redirect rivers for their own convenience, has put the world on the brink. But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s what sages do.
There are n countries, each with exactly k regions. For the j-th region of the i-th country, they calculated the value ai,j, which reflects the amount of water in it.
The sages intend to create channels between the j-th region of the i-th country and the j-th region of the (i+1)-th country for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4(n\xe2\x88\x921) and for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4k. 
Since all n countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number. According to the sages\' predictions, after the channel system is created, the new value of the j-th region of the i-th country will be bi,j=a1,j|a2,j|...|ai,j, where | denotes the bitwise ""OR"" operation.
After the redistribution of water, the sages aim to choose the most suitable country for living, so they will send you q queries for consideration.
Each query will contain m requirements. 
Each requirement contains three parameters: the region number r, the sign o (either ""<"" or "">""), and the value c. If o = ""<"", then in the r-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit c, and if o = "">"", it must be strictly greater.
In other words, the chosen country i must satisfy all m requirements. If in the current requirement o = ""<"", then it must hold that bi,r<c, and if o = "">"", then bi,r>c.
In response to each query, you should output a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the suitable country. If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output \xe2\x88\x921.
The first line contains three integers n, k, and q (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k,q\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.
Next, there are n lines, where the i-th line contains k integers ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,k (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4109), where ai,j is the value of the j-th region of the i-th country.
Then, q queries are described.
The first line of each query contains a single integer m (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of requirements.
Then follow m lines, each containing an integer r, a character o, and an integer c (1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4k, 0\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109), where r and c are the region number and the value, and o is either ""<"" or "">"" \xe2\x80\x94 the sign.
It is guaranteed that n\xe2\x8b\x85k does not exceed 105 and that the sum of m across all queries also does not exceed 105.
For each query, output a single integer on a new line \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest number of the suitable country, or \xe2\x88\x921 if no such country exists.
In the example, the initial values of the regions are as follows:
After creating the channels, the new values will look like this:
In the first query, it is necessary to output the minimum country number (i.e., row) where, after the redistribution of water in the first region (i.e., column), the new value will be greater than four and less than six, and in the second region it will be less than eight. Only the country with number 2 meets these requirements.
In the second query, there are no countries that meet the specified requirements.
In the third query, only the country with number 3 is suitable.
In the fourth query, all three countries meet the conditions, so the answer is the smallest number 1." "1600  x6075"
    
2036D "I Love 1543" "brute force, implementation, matrices" "One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that 1543 is the most favorite number in his life.
The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size n by m cells; n and m are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from 0 to 9.
Polycarp became curious about how many times the number 1543 would appear in all layers\xe2\x88\x97 of the carpet when traversed clockwise.

But Anya loves the number 1100, so after each query, she asks you to tell her whether the substring ""1100"" is present in her string (i.e. there exist such 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x88\x923 that sisi+1si+2si+3=1100).

You can place any number of bottles on each shelf, but all bottles on the same shelf must be of the same brand.
Arseniy knows that all the bottles he puts on the shelves of the machine will be sold. Therefore, he asked you to calculate the maximum amount he can earn.

For each test case, output one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum amount that Arseniy can earn.
In the first test case, Arseniy has 3 shelves in the vending machine. He can place, for example, two bottles of the brand 2 on the first shelf and a bottle of the brand 1 on the second shelf. Then the total cost of the bottles would be 6+7+15=28.
In the second test case, he has only one shelf. It is not difficult to show that the optimal option is to place a bottle of the brand 1 on it. Then the total cost will be 15.
In the third test case, he has as many as 6 shelves, so he can place all available bottles with a total cost of 7+5=12." "800  x21952"

After that, Alice and Jack will take turns alternately, with Alice going first.

Jack is forced to take the only peanut left in the first box, which allows Alice to take the remaining ones in the second box.

The monster\'s nerve system can be structured as a tree\xe2\x80\xa0 of n nodes (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time\xe2\x80\xa6), numbered from 0 to n\xe2\x88\x921, with node 0 as the root.
Gretel\'s objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster\'s nerve system�\xe2\x80\x94 more specifically, she wants to know the values p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn\xe2\x88\x921 of the tree, where pi (0\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i) is the direct parent node of node i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921).
She doesn\'t know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient facts:
Gretel can make queries to the containment cell:
However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel wants to query at most 2n\xe2\x88\x926 times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can\'t do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?
\xe2\x80\xa0A tree is a connected graph where every pair of distinct nodes has exactly one simple path connecting them.
\xe2\x80\xa1A path is a tree whose vertices can be listed in the order v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk such that the edges are (vi,vi+1) (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<k).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 104.
For each test case, interaction starts by reading the integer n.
Then you can make queries of the following type:
After the query, read an integer r�\xe2\x80\x94 the answer to your query. You are allowed to use at most 2n\xe2\x88\x926 queries of this type.
When you find out the structure, output a line in the format ""! p1�p2\xe2\x80\xa6pn\xe2\x88\x921"" (without quotes), where pi (0\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i) denotes the index of the direct parent of node i. This query is not counted towards the 2n\xe2\x88\x926 queries limit.
After solving one test case, the program should immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program should be terminated immediately.
After printing any query do not forget to output an end of line and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
The interactor is non-adaptive. The tree does not change during the interaction.

2031F "Penchick and Even Medians" "binary search, constructive algorithms, interactive" " 
This is an interactive problem. 
Returning from a restful vacation on Australia\'s Gold Coast, Penchick forgot to bring home gifts for his pet duck Duong Canh! But perhaps a beautiful problem crafted through deep thought on the scenic beaches could be the perfect souvenir.
There is a hidden permutation\xe2\x88\x97 p of length n, where n is even. You are allowed to make the following query:
Find the index of the two medians in permutation p using at most 80 queries.
Note that the interactor is non-adaptive. This means that the permutation p is fixed at the beginning and will not change based on your queries.
\xe2\x88\x97A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). 
\xe2\x80\xa0A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions. 
\xe2\x80\xa1The two medians of an array a with even length k are defined as the k2-th and (k2+1)-th smallest element in the array (1-indexed).
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000). The description of the test cases follows. 
The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (6\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, n is even)�\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the hidden permutation p.
For each test case, after reading the integer n, you should begin the interaction and find the answer before reading n for the next test case.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 104. 
To make a query, print a single line in the following format:
After each query, you should read a line containing two integers m1 and m2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4m1<m2\xe2\x89\xa4n)�\xe2\x80\x94 the value of the two medians in array [px1,px2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pxk\xe2\x88\x921,pxk].
You can make at most 80 such queries in each test case.
To give the final answer, print a single line in the following format:
Note that the order in which i1 and i2 is printed does not matter. In other words, your solution is valid as long as pi1=n2 and pi2=n2+1, or pi1=n2+1 and pi2=n2.
After printing each query do not forget to output the end of line and flush\xe2\x88\x97 the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded verdict.
If, at any interaction step, you read \xe2\x88\x921 instead of valid data, your solution must exit immediately. This means that your solution will receive Wrong answer because of an invalid query or any other mistake. Failing to exit can result in an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream. 
Hack format
For hacks, use the following format.
The first line should contain t�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case should contain a single even integer n.
The second line of each test case should contain a permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn of length n.
As an example, the hack format for the example input is: 
\xe2\x88\x97To flush, use: 
In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[6,2,3,5,1,4].

In the second test case, the hidden permutation is p=[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1].

With just a few hours left until Penchick and Chloe leave for Singapore, they could hardly wait to see the towering trees at the Singapore Botanic Gardens! Attempting to contain their excitement, Penchick crafted a rooted tree to keep Chloe and himself busy.
Penchick has a rooted tree\xe2\x88\x97 consisting of n vertices, numbered from 1 to n, with vertex 1 as the root, and Chloe can select a non-negative integer d to create a perfect binary tree\xe2\x80\xa0 of depth d.
Since Penchick and Chloe are good friends, Chloe wants her tree to be isomorphic\xe2\x80\xa1 to Penchick\'s tree. To meet this condition, Chloe can perform the following operation on her own tree any number of times:
In particular, doing an operation on an edge (u,v) where v is a leaf will delete vertex v without adding any new edges.
Since constructing a perfect binary tree can be time-consuming, Chloe wants to choose the minimum d such that a perfect binary tree of depth d can be made isomorphic to Penchick\'s tree using the above operation. Note that she can\'t change the roots of the trees.
\xe2\x88\x97A tree is a connected graph without cycles.  A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root.  The parent of vertex v is the first vertex on the simple path from v to the root. The root has no parent.  A child of vertex v is any vertex u for which v is the parent.  A leaf is any vertex without children. 
\xe2\x80\xa0A full binary tree is rooted tree, in which each node has 0 or 2 children.  A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which every leaf is at the same distance from the root. The depth of such a tree is the distance from the root to a leaf.
\xe2\x80\xa1Two rooted trees, rooted at r1 and r2 respectively, are considered isomorphic if there exists a permutation p of the vertices such that an edge (u,v) exists in the first tree if and only if the edge (pu,pv) exists in the second tree, and pr1=r2.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in Penchick\'s tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 106.
For each test case, output a single integer on each line: the minimum depth of Chloe\'s perfect binary tree.
For the first test case, create a perfect binary tree with depth 2.
Consider carrying out the operation on edge AC. Then the edges AC, CF, and CG are removed, and edges AF and AG are added. 
The resulting tree is isomorphic to the tree given in the input. It can be proven that no sequence of operations carried out on a binary tree of depth less than 2 can lead to a tree isomorphic to the tree given in the input. 
In the second test case, the tree is already isomorphic to a perfect binary tree of depth 3." " x1137"

In the third test case, the starting array is [1,3,5,\xe2\x80\xa6,199]. After the first operation, the 199 gets transformed into a 0. In the second operation, the 197 gets transformed into a 2. If we continue this, it will take exactly 50 operations to get the array [0,1,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,99].

For the second pile, to begin with, Alice can remove between 1 and 6 stones. No matter which move Alice performs, Bob can remove the rest of the stones on his turn. After Bob\'s move, there are no more moves that Alice can perform, so Bob wins.
In the second test case, here is one example of how the game might go. Alice moves first, and she decides to remove from the first pile. She cannot take 17 stones, because 17>10, which fails the first condition. She cannot take 10 stones, because 25&10=8 which fails the second condition. One option is to take 9 stones; now the pile has 16 stones left. On Bob\'s turn he decides to take stones from the second pile; the only option here is to take all 4. Now, no more stones can be taken from either of the first two piles, so Alice must take some stones from the last pile. She decides to take 12 stones, and Bob then follows by taking the last 2 stones on that pile. Since Alice now has no legal moves left, Bob wins.

2023B Skipping "binary search, dp, graphs, shortest paths" "It is already the year 3024, ideas for problems have long run out, and the olympiad now takes place in a modified individual format. The olympiad consists of n problems, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th problem has its own score ai and a certain parameter bi (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n).
Initially, the testing system gives the participant the first problem. When the participant is given the i-th problem, they have two options: 
Then, the testing system selects the next problem for the participant from problems with indices j, such that: 
Among these problems, it selects the problem with the maximum index that it has not previously given to the participant (he has neither submitted nor skipped it before). If there is no such problem, then the competition for the participant ends, and their result is equal to the sum of points for all submitted problems. In particular, if the participant submits the first problem, then the competition for them ends. Note that the participant receives each problem at most once.
Prokhor has prepared thoroughly for the olympiad, and now he can submit any problem. Help him determine the maximum number of points he can achieve.
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

For each test case, output a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of points that Prokhor can achieve.
In the first test case, Prokhor can skip the first problem; then he will receive the problem with index b1=2. Prokhor can submit it and receive a2=16 points. After that, the competition will end because Prokhor has already received all problems. Note that if Prokhor submits the first problem, he will receive a1=15 points, but the competition will end immediately.
In the second test case, Prokhor can skip the first problem; then he will receive the problem with index b1=3. Prokhor can submit it and receive a3=100 points. After that, Prokhor will receive the second problem, which he can skip to receive the problem with index b2=4. Prokhor can submit the fourth problem and receive another a4=100 points. After that, the competition ends because Prokhor has already received all problems with indices not exceeding 4. Thus, Prokhor will receive a total of 200 points.

Once you receive the answer, output a single string in the following format:
After that, proceed to solve the next test case.
If you make an incorrect attempt or exceed the limit of 2n attempts, you will receive \xe2\x88\x921 instead of an answer and get the verdict Wrong answer. In this case, your program should terminate immediately to avoid undefined verdicts.
After outputting the queries, do not forget to output a newline character and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Solution ""hung"". To flush the buffer, use:

To use hacks, use the following format of tests:
The first line should contain a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case should contain a single number n (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)�\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string. The second line should contain a binary string of size n.
In the first example, the string 010 is given. Therefore, the answers to the queries are as follows:
""? 00"" 00 is not a substring of 010, so the answer is 0.
""? 000"" 000 is not a substring, so the answer is 0.
""? 010"" 010 is a substring, so the answer is 1.

In this merging, the end of the first message coincides with the beginning of the second. Of course, the merging can only occur at identical characters. The length of the merging must be a positive number less than the length of the message text.
For example, when transmitting two messages ""abrakadabra"" consecutively, it is possible that it will be transmitted with the described type of error, resulting in a message like ""abrakadabrabrakadabra"" or ""abrakadabrakadabra\' (in the first case, the merging occurred at one character, and in the second case, at four).
Given the received message t, determine if it is possible that this is the result of an error of the described type in the operation of the local network, and if so, determine a possible value of s.
A situation where two messages completely overlap each other should not be considered an error. For example, if the received message is ""abcd"", it should be considered that there is no error in it. Similarly, simply appending one message after another is not a sign of an error. For instance, if the received message is ""abcabc"", it should also be considered that there is no error in it.

2006A "Iris and Game on the Tree" "constructive algorithms, dfs and similar, games, graphs, greedy, trees" "Iris has a tree rooted at vertex 11. Each vertex has a value of 00 or 11.
Let\'s consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex 11 is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of 1010 and 0101 substrings in it.
Take the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of 11 while white vertices have a value of 00.
The score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.
But the values of some vertices haven\'t been decided and will be given to you as ??. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value ?? and changes its value to 00 or 11, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value ?? left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.
Assuming that both girls play optimally, please determine the final score of the tree.
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

It\'s guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
The last line contains a string ss of length nn. The ii-th character of ss represents the value of vertex ii. It\'s guaranteed that ss only contains characters 00, 11 and ??.
It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.
For each test case, output a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the final score of the tree.
In the first test case, all the values of the vertices have been determined. There are three different paths from the root to a leaf:
Thus, there are two leaves with non-zero weight, so the score of the tree is 22.
In the second test case, one of the sequences of optimal choices for the two players can be:
The final tree is as follows:
The only leaf with non-zero weight is 33, so the score of the tree is 11. Note that this may not be the only sequence of optimal choices for Iris and Dora." "1700  x6715"

2005C "Lazy Narek" "dp, implementation, strings" "Narek is too lazy to create the third problem of this contest. His friend Artur suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates n problems, each consisting of m letters, so Narek has n strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the n strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as scoren\xe2\x88\x92scorec, where scoren is Narek\'s score and scorec is ChatGPT\'s score.
Narek calculates scoren by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter ""n"", followed by ""a"", ""r"", ""e"", and ""k"". Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments scoren by 5 and resumes searching for ""n"" again (he doesn\'t go back, and he just continues from where he left off). 
After Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments scorec by 1 for each letter ""n"", ""a"", ""r"", ""e"", or ""k"" that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the 5 letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT\'s score scorec, and Narek doesn\'t get any points if he doesn\'t finish finding all the 5 letters).
Narek aims to maximize the value of scoren\xe2\x88\x92scorec by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.
In the first line of the input, you\'re given a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.
In the first line of each test case, you\'re given two integers n,m (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4103), the number of strings and the length of each string.
In the next n lines, you\'re given n strings, each having a length of m. The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
The sum of values of n\xe2\x8b\x85m over all test cases does not exceed 106.
For each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of scoren\xe2\x88\x92scorec.
In the first test case, one of the optimal answers is when Narek doesn\'t choose any of the strings, so the answer is 0. He can alternatively choose all the strings. In this case, the full string becomes ""nnaarreekk"". Narek can choose the first appearances of all letters and add 5 to the score. His opponent will add 1 for all second appearances, which will be 5 in total. So the answer will be 5\xe2\x88\x925=0.
In the third test case, the only optimal answer is when Narek doesn\'t choose the string. Note that if he were to choose the string, he wouldn\'t be able to find the last letter ""k"", so his score would stay at 0 instead of becoming 5. Then ChatGPT would add 4 for all of the 4 letters, and the answer would become 0\xe2\x88\x924=\xe2\x88\x924.
In the last test case, Narek needs to choose the first and the last strings. After putting these two next to each other, he gets ""nrrareknkarekz"". Narek can choose the letters marked with red and add 10 to his score. Since the black colored letters Narek left behind are eligible for the opponent to claim (they are used in the word ""narek""), the opponent adds all other letters to the score and gets a score of 3. Therefore, the answer is 10\xe2\x88\x923=7." "1800  x6987"

Consider a perfect binary tree with size 2n\xe2\x88\x921, with nodes numbered from 1 to 2n\xe2\x88\x921 and rooted at 1. For each vertex v (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa42n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921), vertex 2v is its left child and vertex 2v+1 is its right child. Each node v also has a value av assigned to it.
Define the operation pop as follows:
Then we say the pop operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, a2v\xe2\x89\xa0a2v+1 would hold whenever choosing between them.
A binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex v (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa42n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921), both av\xe2\x89\xa5a2v and av\xe2\x89\xa5a2v+1 hold.

Initially, av:=0 for every vertex v (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa42n\xe2\x88\x921), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation add exactly k times:

Consider a perfect binary tree with size 2n\xe2\x88\x921, with nodes numbered from 1 to 2n\xe2\x88\x921 and rooted at 1. For each vertex v (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa42n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921), vertex 2v is its left child and vertex 2v+1 is its right child. Each node v also has a value av assigned to it.
Define the operation pop as follows:
Then we say the pop operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, a2v\xe2\x89\xa0a2v+1 would hold whenever choosing between them.

He knows that in a regular bracket sequence (RBS), each opening bracket is paired up with the corresponding closing bracket. So he decided to calculate the cost of RBS as the sum of distances between pairs of corresponding bracket pairs.

Monocarp wants to restore his RBS by placing brackets on the odd positions. But since the restored RBS may not be unique, he wants to choose one with minimum cost. It\'s too hard to do for Monocarp alone, so can you help him?

1989A "Catch the Coin" implementation "Monocarp visited a retro arcade club with arcade cabinets. There got curious about the ""Catch the Coin"" cabinet.
The game is pretty simple. The screen represents a coordinate grid such that: 
At the beginning of the game, the character is located in the center, and n coins appear on the screen�\xe2\x80\x94 the i-th coin is at coordinates (xi,yi). The coordinates of all coins are different and not equal to (0,0).
In one second, Monocarp can move the character in one of eight directions. If the character is at coordinates (x,y), then it can end up at any of the coordinates (x,y+1), (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y), (x+1,y\xe2\x88\x921), (x,y\xe2\x88\x921), (x\xe2\x88\x921,y\xe2\x88\x921), (x\xe2\x88\x921,y), (x\xe2\x88\x921,y+1).
If the character ends up at the coordinates with a coin, then Monocarp collects that coin.
After Monocarp makes a move, all coins fall down by 1, that is, they move from (x,y) to (x,y\xe2\x88\x921). You can assume that the game field is infinite in all directions.
Monocarp wants to collect at least one coin, but cannot decide which coin to go for. Help him determine, for each coin, whether he can collect it.

You are given an array a of length n, consisting of consecutive non-negative integers starting from 0, i.e., ai=i for 0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921 (in 0-based indexing). You need to count the number of k-good subarrays in this array.
As the answer can be very large, output it modulo 109+7.
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.
The single line of each test case contains two integers n, k (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41018,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa460).
For each test case, output a single integer�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of k-good subarrays modulo 109+7.
For the first test case a=[0,1,2,3,4,5], k=1.
To find the answer, let\'s write all the numbers in binary representation:
a=[000,001,010,011,100,101]
From this, it can be seen that the numbers 3 and 5 have 2\xe2\x89\xa5(k=1) ones in their binary representation, so the answer should include all subarrays that do not contain either 3 or 5, which are the subarrays (in 0-based indexing): (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (4, 4)."

1982D "Beauty of the mountains" "brute force, data structures, implementation, math, number theory" "Nikita loves mountains and has finally decided to visit the Berlyand mountain range! The range was so beautiful that Nikita decided to capture it on a map. The map is a table of nn rows and mm columns, with each cell containing a non-negative integer representing the height of the mountain.
He also noticed that mountains come in two types:
Nikita is a very pragmatic person. He wants the sum of the heights of the mountains with snowy caps to be equal to the sum of the heights of the mountains without them. He has arranged with the mayor of Berlyand, Polikarp Polikarpovich, to allow him to transform the landscape.
Nikita can perform transformations on submatrices of size k\xc3\x97kk\xc3\x97k as follows: he can add an integer constant cc to the heights of the mountains within this area, but the type of the mountain remains unchanged. Nikita can choose the constant cc independently for each transformation. Note that cc can be negative.
Before making the transformations, Nikita asks you to find out if it is possible to achieve equality of the sums, or if it is impossible. It doesn\'t matter at what cost, even if the mountains turn into canyons and have negative heights.
If only one type of mountain is represented on the map, then the sum of the heights of the other type of mountain is considered to be zero.
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of test cases.

The next nn binary strings of length mm for each test case determine the type of mountain, \'00\'�\xe2\x80\x94 with snowy caps, \'11\'�\xe2\x80\x94 without them.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m for all test cases does not exceed 250000250000.
For each test case, output ""YES"" without quotes if it is possible to equalize the sums of the mountain heights, otherwise output ""NO"" without quotes. You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as a positive answer).
The mountain array from the first test case looks like this:
Initially, the sum of the heights of the mountains with snowy caps is 11+3+4+3+0+1+15=3711+3+4+3+0+1+15=37, and without them is 7+2=97+2=9.
To equalize these sums, we can perform two transformations:
First transformation:
Note that the constant cc can be negative.
After the first transformation, the mountain array looks like this:
Second transformation:
As a result, the mountain array looks like this:
The sum of the heights of the mountains with snowy caps is 17+9+9\xe2\x88\x9216\xe2\x88\x9220\xe2\x88\x9219+15=\xe2\x88\x92517+9+9\xe2\x88\x9216\xe2\x88\x9220\xe2\x88\x9219+15=\xe2\x88\x925, and without them is 7\xe2\x88\x9212=\xe2\x88\x9257\xe2\x88\x9212=\xe2\x88\x925, thus the answer is YES."

In such a game, the score on the scoreboard is represented as x : y, where x is the number of goals of the first team, and y is the number of goals of the second team. At any given time, only one team can score a goal, so the score x : y can change to either (x+1) : y, or x : (y+1).
While watching a soccer game, Dima was distracted by very important matters, and after some time, he returned to watching the game. Dima remembers the score right before he was distracted, and the score right after he returned. Given these two scores, he wonders the following question. Is it possible that, while Dima was not watching the game, the teams never had an equal score?
It is guaranteed that at neither of the two time points Dima remembers the teams had equal scores. However, it is possible that the score did not change during his absence.

In the first test case, the score before Dima left was 1 : 0. When he leaves, the first team scores several goals in a row until the score becomes 5 : 0, so the answer is YES.
In the second test case, the score could only change as follows:

If a set of paths P={(xi,yi)}P={(xi,yi)} in the tree covers each edge exactly once, then Turtle will think that the set of paths is good. Note that a good set of paths can cover a vertex twice or more.

1980G "Yasya and the Mysterious Tree" "bitmasks, data structures, dfs and similar, graphs, greedy, strings, trees" "Yasya was walking in the forest and accidentally found a tree with n vertices. A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles.
Next to the tree, the girl found an ancient manuscript with m queries written on it. The queries can be of two types.
The first type of query is described by the integer y. The weight of each edge in the tree is replaced by the bitwise exclusive OR of the weight of that edge and the integer y.
The second type is described by the vertex v and the integer x. Yasya chooses a vertex u (1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4n, u\xe2\x89\xa0v) and mentally draws a bidirectional edge of weight x from v to u in the tree.
Then Yasya finds a simple cycle in the resulting graph and calculates the bitwise exclusive OR of all the edges in it. She wants to choose a vertex u such that the calculated value is maximum. This calculated value will be the answer to the query. It can be shown that such a cycle exists and is unique under the given constraints (independent of the choice of u). If an edge between v and u already existed, a simple cycle is the path v\xe2\x86\x92u\xe2\x86\x92v.
Note that the second type of query is performed mentally, meaning the tree does not change in any way after it.

A string s is called k-proper if two conditions are met:
For example, with k=3, the strings 000, 111000111, and 111000 are k-proper, while the strings 000000, 001100, and 1110000 are not.

You are given the number n and the array p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn. Determine how many pairs (l,r) satisfying the conditions are there such that you can sort the permutation if you can only swap two number (x,y) such that l\xe2\x89\xa4x+y\xe2\x89\xa4r (arbitrary number of times, possibly 0).
\xe2\x80\xa0 A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104). The description of the test cases follows.
Description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer n (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).
The second line contains n integers: the array p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n). It is guaranteed that this array is a permutation of length n. 
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, print the number of pairs of integers (l,r) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85n, and you can sort the array under the constraints.
In the first example, we need to be able to swap 1 and 2, so we must be able to swap numbers with sum 3. There are exactly 6 pairs satisfying the condition: (1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(1,4),(2,4) and (3,4), so the answer is 6.
In the second example, the 11 pairs satisfying the condition are (1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,5) and (4,6). For example, if we pick the pair (3,4) we can first swap the numbers 1 and 2 and then the numbers 1 and 3, after this, the permutation is sorted." "2500  x800"
    
1973D "Cat, Fox and Maximum Array Split" "brute force, interactive, math" "This is an interactive problem.
Fox gave Cat two positive integers n and k. She has a hidden array a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an of length n, such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n for every i. Now they are going to play the following game:
For any two integers l,r such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n, define f(l,r)=(r\xe2\x88\x92l+1)\xe2\x8b\x85rmaxx=lax. In other words, f(l,r) is equal to the maximum of the subarray al,\xe2\x80\xa6,ar multiplied by its size.
Cat can ask Fox at most 2n questions about the array. He will tell her two integers l and x (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109), and she will tell him one integer p as the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,r)=x, or n+1 if no such r exists.
Now, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ck\xe2\x88\x921 such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4c1<\xe2\x80\xa6<ck\xe2\x88\x921<n and f(1,c1)=f(c1+1,c2)=\xe2\x80\xa6=f(ck\xe2\x88\x921+1,n)=m. If no such m exists, he should indicate this and take \xe2\x88\x921 as the answer. Note that for k=1, m is always equal to f(1,n).
In other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the array into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the beginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to m, or determine that no such m exists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.
Cat doesn\'t know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the hidden array and the number of subarrays in the desired split.
Now you are allowed to make queries in the following way \xe2\x80\x94 print one line of the form ""?�l�x"" (it must hold that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n and f(l,r)=x, or n+1 if no such r exists. 
If you want to print the answer, output ""!�m"" and you will recieve 1 if your answer is correct and \xe2\x88\x921 otherwise. In the first case, the interaction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer doesn\'t count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don\'t receive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to read whether your answer to the last test case was correct. 
If you receive the integer \xe2\x88\x921 at any moment, it means your program has made an invalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream. 
After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
It is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won\'t exceed 104.
Hacks
The format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain one integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases should follow.
The first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you want to split it into.
The second line should contain n integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n). 
The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 104.
The hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1], [1,2] and [1,3,6,1,2,1]. In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer is \xe2\x88\x921. 
The answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r exists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2\xe2\x8b\x85max(1,3)=6, we will get 2 as the answer, since r=1 doesn\'t satisfy the constraint.
The sample interaction guessed all three answers (1,\xe2\x88\x921 and 6) correctly, so it received 1 after each answer." "2400  x1915"
    
1973C "Cat, Fox and Double Maximum" "constructive algorithms, greedy, implementation, math, sortings" "Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:
You are given an even positive integer n and a permutation\xe2\x80\xa0 p of length n. 
The score of another permutation q of length n is the number of local maximums in the array a of length n, where ai=pi+qi for all i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n). In other words, the score of q is the number of i such that 1<i<n (note the strict inequalities), ai\xe2\x88\x921<ai, and ai>ai+1 (once again, note the strict inequalities). 
Find the permutation q that achieves the maximum score for given n and p. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.
\xe2\x80\xa0 A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
The first line of input contains an integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input you will have to solve.
The first line of each test case contains one even integer n (4\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, n is even)�\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the permutation p.
The second line of each test case contains the n integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n). It is guaranteed that p is a permutation of length n.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases doesn\'t exceed 105.
For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length n (the array q), such that q maximizes the score under the given constraints.
In the first example, a=[3,6,4,7]. The array has just one local maximum (on the second position), so the score of the chosen permutation q is 1. It can be proven that this score is optimal under the constraints.
In the last example, the resulting array a=[6,6,12,7,14,7,14,6] has 3 local maximums�\xe2\x80\x94 on the third, fifth and seventh positions. " "1700  x8382"
    
1973B "Cat, Fox and the Lonely Array" "binary search, bitmasks, data structures, greedy, math, two pointers" "Today, Cat and Fox found an array a consisting of n non-negative integers. 
Define the loneliness of a as the smallest positive integer k (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n) such that for any two positive integers i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+1), the following holds: ai|ai+1|\xe2\x80\xa6|ai+k\xe2\x88\x921=aj|aj+1|\xe2\x80\xa6|aj+k\xe2\x88\x921, where x|y denotes the bitwise OR of x and y. In other words, for every k consecutive elements, their bitwise OR should be the same. Note that the loneliness of a is well-defined, because for k=n the condition is satisfied.
Cat and Fox want to know how lonely the array a is. Help them calculate the loneliness of the found array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai<220)�\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 105.
For each test case, print one integer �\xe2\x80\x94 the loneliness of the given array.
In the first example, the loneliness of an array with a single element is always 1, so the answer is 1. 
In the second example, the OR of each subarray of length k=1 is 2, so the loneliness of the whole array is 1.
In the seventh example, it\'s true that (0|1|3)=(1|3|2)=(3|2|2)=(2|2|1)=(2|1|0)=(1|0|3)=3, so the condition is satisfied for k=3. We can verify that the condition is not true for any smaller k, so the answer is indeed 3." "1300  x14125"

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1.

Once again, there is a conflict about the score: the two teams are convinced that they won the game! To prevent this problem from happening one more time, you decide to get involved in the refereeing of the matches.
Now, you will stay in the stadium to watch the game and count the score. At the end of the game, you will decide the winner.
Today, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw (B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa410).
The field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa499, N and M are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed to be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the field contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five goals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. In this version of the problem, one Bludger and a Golden Snitch can be present.
A game is composed of T steps (0\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000). At each step, one entity on the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move. A player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To catch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle does not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the movements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it, the Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player. If a player is on the same cell as a Bludger (either after a movement from the player or the Bludger), the player is eliminated. If the player is eliminated while it is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move. It is guaranteed that this never occurs while the player is in a cell containing a goal.
To win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team. When it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly moves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2-th column of the (N+1)/2-th line of the field, starting from 1).

Today, two teams are competing: the red Gryffindor (R) and the blue Ravenclaw (B) team. Each team is composed of P players (1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa410).
The field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa499, N and M are odd). All the positions are integers, and several entities are allowed to be at the same position in the field. At the beginning of the game, the field contains goals for the two teams (each team can own between one and five goals), the players, and exactly one Quaffle. Other types of balls will be available in the harder versions of the problem.
A game is composed of T steps (0\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000). At each step, one entity on the field (a player or a ball) performs one action. All entities can move. A player can also catch a ball or throw the Quaffle that it is carrying. To catch a ball, a player must be located on the same cell as it. The Quaffle does not perform any action while it is being carried; it only follows the movements of the player. If a player carrying the Quaffle decides to throw it, the Quaffle is simply put at the current position of the player.
To win a point, a player must leave the Quaffle at a goal of the other team. When it does, the team of the player wins one point, and the Quaffle instantly moves to the middle of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2-th column of the (N+1)/2-th line of the field, starting from 1). There is no goal in the middle of the field. If a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team wins the point.
On the first line, the integers N and M.
The description of the field follows: N lines of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters represents a position on the field. It can be either: 
The next line contains T, the number of steps that compose the game. T lines follow, each describing one action. It contains several pieces of information separated by a space. First, a pair of characters representing the entity that must perform the action. Second, the description of the action: 
All the actions performed by the entities are guaranteed to be valid: the players stay in the field, don\'t catch a ball if they are not in the same cell, don\'t release the Quaffle if they are not carrying it, ...
You must output the description of the main events of the game, one event per line. More precisely:
The events must be printed in ascending order of t.
At the end of the game, you must print the final score as: FINAL SCORE: r b, where r is the score of the red team and b is the score of the blue team.
In the first example, a blue player goes to the middle of the grid, at the position of the Quaffle. He takes it, goes to the goal of the red team, and lets the ball there. He scores! The ball gets back to the middle of the field, a red player takes it and scores too.
In the second example, the red player takes the Quaffle, move it and throw it. The blue player catches the ball, goes to the red goal and scores.
In the third example, the red player takes the ball and scores in the goal of their own team: the blue team wins a point." "2300  x426"

1970D3 "Arithmancy (Hard)" interactive "The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value of n.
Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and XOXO.
Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words. Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work, and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.
Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.
This is an interactive problem.
First, your program should read a single integer n (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000), the number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must have at least 1 and at most 30\xe2\x8b\x85n characters, and each character must be either X or O. We will denote the i-th magic word you printed as wi (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n).
Then, your program should read a single integer q (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41000), the number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process q times, one per student.
For the j-th student, it should first read a single integer pj, the power of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two indices uj and vj independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n inclusive, concatenating wuj and wvj, and finding the number of different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program must print the numbers uj and vj, in this order (1\xe2\x89\xa4uj,vj\xe2\x89\xa4n).
Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student in the exact order.

1970B1 "Exact Neighbours (Easy)" "constructive algorithms" "The only difference between this and the hard version is that all ai are even.
After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of the Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses will be situated on a picturesque n\xc3\x97n square field. Each wizard will have their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house will take up the space of one square.
However, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the weekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly ai (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are built horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (xi,yi) and (xj,yj) on the n\xc3\x97n field is |xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|+|yi\xe2\x88\x92yj|. The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit another wizard\'s house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built will be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.
Apart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle in the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other wizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each column of the n\xc3\x97n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i-th house has coordinates (xi,yi), then xi\xe2\x89\xa0xj for all i\xe2\x89\xa0j.
The Order of the Phoenix doesn\'t yet know if it is possible to place n houses in such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n wizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.
If it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i-th wizard there is a house that is ai away from it and the house of the i-th wizard is the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each wizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the weekends.
If it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.
The first line contains n (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105), the number of houses to be built.
The second line contains n integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n). All ai are even.
If there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise, output NO.
If the answer is YES, output n+1 more lines describing the placement.
The next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n for each wizard.
The i-th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the house of which is exactly ai away from the house of the i-th wizard. If there are multiple such wizards, you can output any.
If there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41012)�\xe2\x80\x94 the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105.
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum score you can get.
In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (including 11 single 1s), which contains 11 subarrays consisting of a permutation of [1].
In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]. There are 8 subarrays equal to [1,2] and 7 subarrays equal to [2,1], which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation of [1,2]. It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.
In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,3]." "1400  x12528"

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings ""yEs"", ""yes"", ""Yes"", and ""YES"" will be recognized as positive responses.
In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square with an operation, so we output NO.
The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.
In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so we output YES.
In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select positions (2,1) and (1,4) and color all squares with 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa42 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa44 to white.

Notice that for the above folding of s=01110s=01110, if we made either of the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However, because we don\'t check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is valid.

If the target\'s health value goes to 0 or below, it dies, and all next spells cast at it do nothing.
There are also m composite spells in the spell book, numbered from n+1 to n+m. Each composite spell is a sequence of other spells, cast in specific order. A composite spell can consist both of basic spells and composite spells; the i-th spell consists of si other spells, and each of those spells has index strictly less than i (so there is no situation that composite spells infinitely cast each other).

1955H "The Most Reckless Defense" "bitmasks, brute force, constructive algorithms, dp, flows, graph matchings, shortest paths" "You are playing a very popular Tower Defense game called ""Runnerfield 2"". In this game, the player sets up defensive towers that attack enemies moving from a certain starting point to the player\'s base.
You are given a grid of size n\xc3\x97m, on which k towers are already placed and a path is laid out through which enemies will move. The cell at the intersection of the x-th row and the y-th column is denoted as (x,y).
Each second, a tower deals pi units of damage to all enemies within its range. For example, if an enemy is located at cell (x,y) and a tower is at (xi,yi) with a range of r, then the enemy will take damage of pi if (x\xe2\x88\x92xi)2+(y\xe2\x88\x92yi)2\xe2\x89\xa4r2.
Enemies move from cell (1,1) to cell (n,m), visiting each cell of the path exactly once. An enemy instantly moves to an adjacent cell horizontally or vertically, but before doing so, it spends one second in the current cell. If its health becomes zero or less during this second, the enemy can no longer move. The player loses if an enemy reaches cell (n,m) and can make one more move.
By default, all towers have a zero range, but the player can set a tower\'s range to an integer r (r>0), in which case the health of all enemies will increase by 3r. However, each r can only be used for at most one tower.
Suppose an enemy has a base health of h units. If the tower ranges are 2, 4, and 5, then the enemy\'s health at the start of the path will be h+32+34+35=h+9+81+243=h+333. The choice of ranges is made once before the appearance of enemies and cannot be changed after the game starts.
Find the maximum amount of base health h for which it is possible to set the ranges so that the player does not lose when an enemy with health h passes through (without considering the additions for tower ranges).
The first line contains an integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (2\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa450,1\xe2\x89\xa4k<n\xe2\x8b\x85m) \xe2\x80\x94 the dimensions of the field and the number of towers on it.
The next n lines each contain m characters \xe2\x80\x94 the description of each row of the field, where the character ""."" denotes an empty cell, and the character ""#"" denotes a path cell that the enemies will pass through.
Then follow k lines \xe2\x80\x94 the description of the towers. Each line of description contains three integers xi, yi, and pi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4m,1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the tower and its attack parameter. All coordinates correspond to empty cells on the game field, and all pairs (xi,yi) are pairwise distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n\xe2\x8b\x85m does not exceed 2500 for all test cases.
For each test case, output the maximum amount of base health h on a separate line, for which it is possible to set the ranges so that the player does not lose when an enemy with health h passes through (without considering the additions for tower ranges).
If it is impossible to choose ranges even for an enemy with 1 unit of base health, output ""0"".
In the first example, there is no point in increasing the tower range, as it will not be able to deal enough damage to the monster even with 1 unit of health.
In the second example, the tower has a range of 1, and it deals damage to the monster in cells (1,1) and (2,2).
In the third example, the tower has a range of 2, and it deals damage to the monster in all path cells. If the enemy\'s base health is 1491, then after the addition for the tower range, its health will be 1491+32=1500, which exactly equals the damage the tower will deal to it in three seconds.
In the fourth example, the tower at (1,2) has a range of 1, and the tower at (3,1) has a range of 2." "2300  x1263"

It is guaranteed that the sum of n2 over all test cases does not exceed 25\xe2\x8b\x85104.
For each test case, output ""YES"" in a separate line if a progressive square for the given n, c, and d can be constructed from the array elements a, otherwise output ""NO"".

1953A "Accuracy-Preserving Summation Algorithm" "*special problem" "In the classic high-performance computing domain (HPC), the vast majority of computations are conducted in double-precision 64-bit floating-point numbers (fp64, double-precision, IEEE-754 binary64). The rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) resulted in hardware (HW) capable of processing 16-bit floating point numbers (fp16, half precision, IEEE-754 binary16) up to 16 times faster in terms of floating-point operations per second (flops) and up to 4 times faster in terms of memory bandwidth (BW). At the same time, the short mantissa and exponent for fp16 numbers lead to a very fast loss of precision of computations, producing wrong computational results without any option to recover them in reduction operations of size greater than approximately 2000. As the typical problem size in HPC is much larger than 2000, this makes fp16 computations almost useless. To surmount this major roadblock, smarter algorithms for reduction operations are needed.
Description. There is a sequence of floating-point numbers stored in IEEE-754 binary64 (double precision, fp64) format xi of length N. The sequence needs to be summed up to S=x1+x2+\xe2\x80\xa6+xN. As professional computer equipment with native support for fp16 is usually unavailable to the general audience, we propose to do operations in a simplified simulated environment, that is, we do computations in fp64 format with mantissa and exponent cut to the range admissible in fp16. In particular, small values that do not fit fp16 admissible range turn into zeros, while excessively large values turn into infinities. 
Objective. Your objective is to sum up as many sequences as possible as fast as possible and as accurately as possible. Please note that you may do summation in fp64 format, but the summation process would be slow though accurate. If you do plain summation in fp16 format, it can be fast, but inaccurate, especially for larger sequences.
The input consists of a single line. It starts with an integer N representing the number of values in the sequence. The following N double precision numbers form the sequence xi, where i=1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N. 
Variable constraints:
Note that the actual binary64 value is not always exactly equal to the given decimal value. Instead, the actual given value is the closest number representable in binary64. When reading the input, most programming languages will do the conversion for you automatically.
It is guaranteed that every number in the sequence either is 0 or has absolute value between 10\xe2\x88\x92300 and 10300, inclusive.
Print a single line which will describe the summation process. The line should contain an encoded algorithm for the summation. We use this encoding to do actual summation and report the result to prevent the need to seek hardware capable of doing fp16 operations natively.
An encoded algorithm consists of the data type to use, followed by a list of values to sum up using this data type. The result of the algorithm is the sum of the given values, as computed in the given data type, from left to right, in the given order. It looks as follows:
As you can see, the whole algorithm is surrounded by curly brackets (""{"" and ""}""). The next character represents one of the three possible data types: 
Then goes a colon ("":""). It is followed by a non-empty list of values to sum up, separated by commas ("",""). Note that there are no spaces.
Each value can be one of the following: 
Some examples: 
Each input value must be used exactly once.
In this problem, there are 2 example tests and 76 main tests. Each main test is scored as follows.
The first part of scoring is related to accuracy. We denote the sum calculated by the solution as Sc. Next, we calculate the expected sum Se as precisely as we can, and store it in binary64 format. Then the accuracy score is calculated as: A=(max(|Sc\xe2\x88\x92Se|max(|Se|,10\xe2\x88\x92200),10\xe2\x88\x9220))0.05.
For example, if the calculated sum is 99.0 and the expected sum is 100.0, the accuracy score is A=(|99\xe2\x88\x92100||100|)0.05=(1100)0.05=0.794328.... If the relative error is 11000, the accuracy score is A=(11000)0.05=0.707945.... If the solution is exact, we get A=(10\xe2\x88\x9220)0.05=0.1.
The second part of scoring is related to the types used for summation. We define the weight W of the algorithm as follows. If the algorithm performs k additions (adding up k+1 values), its weight is: 
The third part of scoring is related to a penalty for memory reads. We list the N numbers appearing in the algorithm from left to right, omitting all curly brackets. We divide the numbers into consecutive blocks of 16 elements; the last block may contain less than 16 elements. In each block, its first element i initiates a memory read. For every other element j of the block, if |j\xe2\x88\x92i|>15, it is too far from the memory which was read for this block, and you get a penalty. The penalties increase gradually: the x-th penalty you get will be x/20000. The penalty counter x is global, it persists across different blocks. All the penalties add up to the total penalty P.
For example, consider the following algorithm: {s:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,{d:20,19,18,17,16},11,12,13,14,15}. It performs 15 additions in single precision, and one of its elements is also an algorithm which performs 4 additions in double precision. Thus its weight is W=15\xe2\x8b\x852+4\xe2\x8b\x854=46. The first memory read block is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,19,18,17,16,11, the initial read is at position 1, and the positions in the block that are more than 15 units away are 20, 19, 18, and 17, so we get 4 penalties. The second memory read block is 12,13,14,15, the initial read is at position 12, and there are no penalties. The total penalty is P=(1+2+3+4)/20000=0.0005.
Putting the second and third part together, we calculate the average cost for a single operation as: C=W+PN\xe2\x88\x921. Then the data score is calculated as: D=10.0\xe2\x88\x9aC+0.5. Lastly, taking the accuracy score into account, the score for the test is: Score=DA. All individual test scores for main tests sum up together to produce the final score. Examples are checked, but do not contribute to the score.
Two sets of tests are prepared in this problem: preliminary tests and final tests. For the duration of the competition, each submission is tested on the preliminary set of tests. When the competition is finished, for each contestant:
The two sets of tests are designed to be similar, but not identical." "  1952J"
